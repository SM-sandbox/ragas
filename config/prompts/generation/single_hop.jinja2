Document content:
{{ content }}

Generate ONE {{ difficulty }} single-hop question that:
1. Can be answered directly from this document
2. Is HIGHLY RELEVANT to a field technician's work (equipment specs, safety limits, configuration, troubleshooting)
3. Has a clear, factual answer
4. Is NOT about document metadata (revision numbers, authors, dates, form fields)

Difficulty: {{ difficulty }}
- easy: Direct fact lookup (e.g., "What is the maximum voltage rating?")
- medium: Requires understanding context (e.g., "What safety precaution is required before maintenance?")
- hard: Requires synthesis or comparison (e.g., "How does the fault detection differ between modes?")

Respond with JSON only:
{
    "question": "Your question here",
    "ground_truth_answer": "The correct answer",
    "reasoning": "Why this is a good technical question for field techs"
}
