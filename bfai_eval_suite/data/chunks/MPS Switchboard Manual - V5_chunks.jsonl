Then, check the lifting capacity of\nall available hoisting and lifting equipment, and only use the cranes\nand forklifts if their load capacity exceeds the weight of each section. Do not use damaged hooks, slings, or cables. Only lift the\nswitchboard from the provided lifting provisions, like lifting points\nand lifting bars, on the equipment. The sections can be moved by\nattaching the lifting bars at the top of the switchboard to a crane with at\nleast four lift cables. If crane facilities are unavailable due to space or\nbudget constraints, rollers can be fitted beneath the skids to facilitate\nmovement. Take care when lifting the unit and removing it from the\ntruck so it does not get damaged. A. Lifting By Means of an Overhead Crane\nLifting brackets are installed at the top and rear positions of the\nswitchboard section, as depicted in Figure 3-1. These brackets are\nused to lift the section using overhead cranes. There are two methods Figure 3-3 Multi-Section Lifting\nfor lifting the switchboard sections when using an overhead crane,\ndepending on the number of sections of the switchboard equipment.
