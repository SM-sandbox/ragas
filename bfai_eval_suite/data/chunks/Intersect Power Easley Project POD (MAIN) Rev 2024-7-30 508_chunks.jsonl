PROJECT OVERVIEW\n1.1. Introduction\nIP Easley I, LLC, Easley II, LLC, and Easley III, LLC (Applicant or Proponent), subsidiaries of Intersect Power,\nLLC, propose to construct, operate and decommission the Easley Renewable Energy Project (Easley or\nProject), a utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) electrical generating and storage facility, and associated\ninfrastructure to generate and deliver renewable electricity to the statewide electricity transmission grid.\nThe proposed Project application area is located on approximately 3,735 acres of private (990 acres) and\nBLM (2,745 acres)-administered land, in Riverside County north of Desert Center, California (see Figure\n1). The project would generate up to 400 MW and store up to 650 megawatts (MW) of renewable\nelectricity via arrays of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, battery energy storage system (BESS), and\nappurtenant facilities. A 6.7-mile 500 kilovolt (kV) generation-tie (gen-tie) line would mainly traverse\nacross the Oberon Renewable Energy Project site and connect into the existing Oberon substation. The\nOberon Project is an adjacent solar and energy storage facility owned by Intersect Power. From the\nOberon onsite substation, the power generated by the Easley Project would be transmitted to the SCE\nRed Bluff Substation via the existing Oberon 500 kV gen-tie line (see Figure 2).\nPublic lands within the Project solar application area are lands designated as Development Focus Area\n(DFA) by the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan (DRECP) and associated Record of Decision\n(ROD), and thus, have been targeted for renewable energy development. Because the proposed Project\nis partially located on federal land under management of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the\nBLM is the lead agency under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. section 4321 et seq.\nRiverside County will be the lead agency under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).\nDepending on the timing of the interconnection agreement, the Easley Project could be online as early as\nlate 2025. The Project would operate for a minimum of 35 years and up to 50 or more years. At the end\nof its useful life, the Project would be decommissioned, and the land returned to its pre-Project conditions.\nRevegetation would be conducted in accordance with the Decommissioning and Revegetation Plan.\n1.2. Background on BLM Filings Related to the Easley Renewable Energy\nProject\nSeveral of the Easley parcels were included in Standard Form (SF-) 299 applications and amendments by\nAurora Solar, LLC, Starlight 2020, LLC, and IP Oberon, LLC, between November 2017 to February 2021.

BLM updated the project serial\nnumber to CACA-057822. With the amendment, the total project area then totaled 10,160 acres, of which\n8,338 acres were BLM-administered land and 1,822 acres were private lands. In July 2022, the Applicant\nsubmitted another SF-299 amendment removing 3,847 acres of BLM-administered public lands from the\nProject application area.1 The BLM lands removed were primarily the eastern and central parcels which\nincluded the following resources. \uf0a1 Northern half of central parcel and entire eastern parcel comprised of aeolian sands; thereby, impacting\ndesign of the Project site since sand movement must be considered (CMAs DFA-VPL-BIO-DUNE-1 and\nDFA-VPL-BIO-DUNE-2). \uf0a1 Potentially 2 rare plants of concern could be located within aeolian sands: chapparal sand verbena\n(Abronia aillosa var aurita) and Harwood's wooly aster (Eriastrum harwoodii) requiring 0.25-mile\navoidance setback (CMA LUPA-BIO-PLANT-2). \uf0a1 High occupancy of Mojave fringe-toed lizard within the active aeolian sand areas. \uf0a1 Desert dry wash woodland on southern half of central parcels requiring 200-foot avoidance setback\n(CMAs LUPA-BIO-RIPWET-1 and LUPA-BIO-13). \uf0a1 Potential cultural resources sensitivity. Because these resources presented inconsistencies with the DRECP Conservation Management Actions\n(CMAs), the parcels were removed from the project footprint. The Proposed Action described herein now\nincludes 2,745 acres of BLM lands and 990 acres of private lands. 1.3. Proponent\u2019s Purpose and Need for the Project\nThe Proponent\u2019s purpose of the Project is to generate, store, and transmit renewable energy to the\nstatewide wholesale electricity grid. The Proponent\u2019s identified need for the Project is to:\n1. Support climate and clean energy goals of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 by helping to tackle\nthe climate crisis and work towards achievement of President Biden\u2019s goal of a zero-carbon power\nsector by 2035 and zero-carbon economy by 2050 through development of clean electricity (power\nsector). 2. Assist the nation to meet its Nationally Determined Contribution commitments under Article 4 of the\nParis Climate Agreement to achieve a 50 to 52 percent reduction in U.S. greenhouse gas pollution\nfrom 2005 levels by 2030, and to achieve 100 percent carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035 in the\nelectricity sector. 3. Further the purpose of Secretarial Order 3285A1, establishing the development of environmentally\nresponsible renewable energy as a priority for the Department of the Interior. 4. Deliver up to 400 MW of affordable, wholesale renewable energy to California ratepayers under long-\nterm contracts with electricity service providers. 5."}

Approval of the Easley Renewable Energy Project on public lands involves a federal action and is thus\nsubject to the environmental analysis requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Because the construction, operation, and decommissioning of the proposed Action would be conducted\nin accordance with DRECP CMAs, an Environmental Assessment (EA) under NEPA is anticipated. The EA\nwould tier to the DRECP Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS). The DRECP is a collaborative,\ninteragency landscape-scale planning effort covering 22.5 million acres in seven California counties\u2014\nImperial, Inyo, Kern, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, and San Diego. The DRECP has two primary goals. One is to provide a streamlined process for the development of utility-\nscale renewable energy generation and transmission in the deserts of southern California consistent with\nfederal and state renewable energy targets and policies. The other is to provide for the long-term conser-\nvation and management of special-status species and desert vegetation communities, as well as other\nphysical, cultural, scenic, and social resources within the DRECP Plan Area using durable regulatory mech-\nanisms."}

The Easley solar and energy storage facility is located on private and\nBLM-administered land, with the legal description in POD Appendix B. Figure 1 (Project Vicinity) illustrates the location of the proposed Project and its relationship to major\nhighways, access roads, and communities. Figure 2 (Project Area) shows the Project area and gen-tie line,\nand Figure 3 shows only the Project components on BLM-administered land. Nearby land uses include\npreviously developed or developing solar facilities, transmission lines, fallow and active agriculture, and\nrural residences. The existing Desert Sunlight and Desert Harvest solar projects are north of the proposed Project, the Athos\nRenewable Energy Project is located to the east, the Oberon Renewable Energy Project to the southeast,\nand the Palen Solar Project farther to the southeast. Solar projects that are under construction nearby\ninclude the Arica and Victory Pass Solar Projects. The Sapphire Solar Project, proposed by EDF\nRenewables, is adjacent to the northern area of the Easley Project. Figure 4, East Riverside Solar Projects\n& DRECP Context, shows the proposed Easley Project in relation to other existing, approved, and proposed\nsolar facilities in eastern Riverside County and illustrates the proposed consolidation of the gen-tie\ncorridors. The Project site is outside of but near desert tortoise critical habitat and the Desert Wildlife Management\nArea (DWMA). Alligator Rock Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) is approximately 3 miles south\nof the Project site and the closest Joshua Tree National Park boundary is located approximately 4 miles\nnortheast of the Project site. The Project site includes a desert tortoise linkage area as defined in the\nDRECP, the Pinto Wash Linkage, but is outside of the Chuckwalla ACEC. The Project is situated within the\nDesert Center, Victory Pass, East of Victory Pass, and Corn Spring 7.5 USGS topographic quadrangles. The Project is located within the Chuckwalla Valley Groundwater Basin (CVGB), which is located in eastern\nRiverside County and encompasses an area of approximately 904 square miles. The CVGB is located within\nthe jurisdiction of the Colorado River Basin Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) and is subject\nto management direction of the Water Quality Control Plan (Basin Plan) for the Colorado River Basin\n(Region 7). The CVGB is bounded by consolidated rocks of the Chuckwalla, Little Chuckwalla, and Mule\nMountains on the south, of the Eagle Mountains on the west, and of the Mule and McCoy Mountains on\nthe east. Rocks of the Coxcomb, Granite, Palen, and Little Maria Mountains bound the valley on the north."}

Many solar panels on multiple rows combined together and controlled by a single motor create\none system called a solar tracker. For large electric utility or industrial applications, hundreds of solar\ntrackers are interconnected to form a utility-scale PV system. The proposed solar facility would include several million solar panels; the final panel count would depend\non the technology ultimately selected at the time of procurement. The ultimate decision for the panel\ntypes and racking systems described here would depend on market conditions and environmental factors,\nincluding the recycling potential of the panels at the end of their useful lives. Types of panels that may be installed include thin-film panels, crystalline silicon panels, or any other\ncommercially available PV technology. Solar thermal technology, in which solar energy is used to heat a\nliquid as an intermediate step to generating electricity, is not being considered. The proposed panel\nmounting system will depend on the PV panels ultimately selected, but the Applicant is currently planning\nto use a single axis tracker with a portrait module orientation. Either mono-facial or bi-facial modules\ncould be used, and modules would be mounted as single panels. A diagram of a typical single-axis tracker\nis shown in Figures 5 and 6)."}

The piles typically\nwould be spaced 10 feet apart north-to-south, and 17 feet to 25 feet apart east-to-west with a 50% to\n30% ground cover ratio (GCR). For a single-axis tracking system, piles typically would be installed to a\nreveal height of approximately 12 inches above grade (but could be higher to compensate for terrain\nvariations and clearance due to water/flooding). For single axis tracking systems, following pile\ninstallation, the associated motors, torque tubes, and drivelines (if applicable) would be placed and\nsecured. Some designs allow for PV panels to be secured directly to the torque tubes using appropriate\npanel clamps. For some single-axis tracking systems a galvanized metal racking system, which secures the\nPV panels to the installed foundations, would be field-assembled and attached according to the manu-\nfacturer\u2019s guidelines. Tracking arrays would be oriented along a north-south axis with panels tracking east\nto west to follow the movement of the sun.

Underground cables would be installed to convey the direct current (DC) electricity from the panels via\ncombiner boxes located throughout the PV arrays, to inverters located at the Power Conversion Station\nthat would convert the DC to alternating current (AC) electricity. The output voltage of the inverters would\nbe stepped up to the required collection system voltage at pad mount transformers located near the\ninverters within the Power Conversion Station. The Applicant anticipates undergrounding the Easley collector lines except for short segments where\noverhead lines may be required due to engineering or other feasibility constraints. The 34.5 kV level\ncollection cables would be buried underground in a trench about 4 feet deep, with segments installed\noverhead on wood poles to connect all of the solar facility development areas to the onsite substation,\nwhich may involve an overhead or underground crossing of Rice Road/Highway 177.

The Project\u2019s SCADA system would inter-\nconnect to this fiber optic network at the onsite substation and may include an up to 50-foot telecom\npole. The California Independent Systems Operator (CAISO) and project's interconnecting utility, SCE, require\nthat 500 kV power plant interconnection facilities contain three fiber optic communications lines \u2013 one\nprimary and two redundant. They must be separate to ensure full and true redundancy. Therefore, the Easley Project requires three paths of communications between the substations with at\nleast 30 feet of separation between each line. As a result, two of those communication lines would be\nattached on the 500 kV gen-tie line transmission structures. A third fiber optic line would be installed\nunderground, likely in the gen-tie line access road to accommodate the separation requirements and\nminimize operational visual impacts. The underground fiber optic line would be installed in a trench\napproximately one foot wide by two feet deep. 2.8. Battery Energy Storage System\nBattery energy storage systems (BESS) can assist grid operators in more effectively integrating intermit-\ntent renewable resources into the statewide grid. The Project could include, at the Applicant\u2019s option, a\nbattery energy storage system capable of storing up to 650 MW of electricity for up to 4 hours, requiring\nup to 35 acres that would be located near the substation (see Figure 11 for a photograph of a typical BESS\nenclosure). If provided, the storage system would consist of battery banks housed in electrical enclosures\nand buried electrical conduit. The battery system would be located near the Project switching station to\nfacilitate interconnection and metering. Alternatively, smaller individual BESS systems may be located\nnear each the inverters. Approximately 500 electrical enclosures (\u201cMegapacks\u201d) would be installed in six 4-foot storage containers,\neach measuring approximately 40 feet by 8 feet by 8.5 feet high, on concrete foundations designed for\nsecondary containment. The Project could use any commercially available battery technology, including\nbut not limited to lithium ion, zinc, lead acid, vanadium, sodium sulfur, and sodium or nickel hydride. Battery systems would require air conditioners or heat exchangers and inverters. In addition, three\n15,000-gallon water tanks are anticipated to provide fire safety. The BESS would comply with the current California Fire Code (CFC), which governs the code requirements\nto minimize the risk of fire and life safety hazards specific to battery energy storage systems used for load\nshedding, load sharing and other grid services (Chapter 12 Section 1206 of the 2019 CFC). In accordance\nwith the CFC, the battery enclosure and the site installation design are all required to be approved by the\nState Fire Marshal."}

In some locations, such as at solar array pile locations, root balls\nwould need to be removed, which would require light grading. Woody vegetation, such as palo verde\ntrees, that are in areas adjacent to infrastructure where it does not impact solar panel performance would\nbe partially cut, leaving the lower trunk intact to allow regrowth of branches and leaves. Certain areas of\nthe site with highly irregular topography that provide important hydrologic functions to the site would be\navoided by project design. Other irregular areas would be leveled or smoothed to provide for construction\naccess and installation. Best management practices identified in the project Fugitive Dust Control Plan would be implemented\nduring all grading and vegetation removal activities, including the possibility of using mulching. To reduce\nwater usage, calcium chloride or a similar soil binder approved by BLM may be applied to dirt roadways\nfor dust abatement purposes. Additional best management practices (BMPs) for site preparation and\nconstruction are also listed in Section 7 (Applicant Proposed Measures and Best Management Practices).

Construction Phase 2: Photovoltaic Panel System\nConstruction of the O&M building and the 12 kV distribution line connection (including relocation of\nexisting distribution line(s)) would be part of the initial solar facility development in tandem with the\nbeginning of PV module construction. The construction activities associated with the distribution line\nwould be similar to the medium voltage collector lines described below. Dismantling and removal of\nexisting SCE distribution line for relocation would be similar to the process described for decommissioning. The poles and conductor would be disposed of as described in Section 3.12 (Waste Generation). The site\nof the O&M building would be cleared and graded, followed by installation of a concrete foundation. All or a portion of the PV panel arrays may be pre-assembled in a fabrication assembly plant located on\nsite. The structures supporting the PV module arrays would consist of steel piles (e.g., cylindrical pipes,\nH beams, or similar) driven into the soil using pneumatic techniques, similar to a hydraulic rock hammer\nattachment on the boom of a rubber-tired backhoe excavator. The piles typically are spaced 10 feet apart\nin the north-south direction and 22 feet apart in the east-west direction. For a single-axis tracking system,\npiles typically would be installed to a reveal height of approximately 4 to 6 feet above grade, while a fixed-\ntilt system the reveal height would vary between 3 to 6 feet above grade based on the racking\nconfiguration specified in the final design. For single axis tracking systems, following pile installation the\nassociated motors, torque tubes, and drivelines (if applicable) would be placed and secured. Some designs\nallow for PV panels to be secured directly to the torque tubes using appropriate panel clamps. For some\nsingle-axis tracking systems and for all fixed-tilt systems, a galvanized metal racking system, which secures\nthe PV panels to the installed foundations, would be field-assembled and attached according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s guidelines. 3.6. Construction Phase 3: Inverters, Transformers, Substation and Electrical\nCollector System, and BESS\nDirect current (DC) lines would be installed in conduits. The lines would be collected and combined and\nrouted to the inverters to be converted to alternating current (AC) and stepped up to 34.5 kV via a pad\nmount transformer. Within the arrays this wiring would typically be hung from the racking equipment. Final sections would be connected to the inverters via an underground stub. Trenches for the collector\nlines would be run from the inverters to the onsite project substation. Electrical inverters would be placed on steel skids or concrete pads, elevated as necessary with steel piles\nto allow for runoff to flow beneath the inverter structures."}

Shields or trench shoring would be temporarily\ninstalled for safety to brace the walls of the trench, if required based on the trench depth. After the exca-\nvation, cable rated for direct burial would be installed in the trench, and the excavated soil would be used\nto fill the trench and compress to 90 to 95 percent maximum dry density or in accordance with final\nengineering. For any overhead 34.5 kV line, pole foundations would be excavated to an average depth of approximately\n10 feet. Installation would consist of the following basic steps:\n\uf0a1 Deliver new pole to installation site. \uf0a1 Auger new hole using line truck attachment to a depth of up to 35 feet and include concrete supports\ndepending on final engineering. \uf0a1 Pour concrete foundation. \uf0a1 Install bottom pole section by line truck, crane, or helicopter; and\n\uf0a1 Install top pole section(s) by line truck, crane, or helicopter, if required. Once poles are erected, the 34.5 kV conductor will be strung generally using a wire truck, crane and/or\nhelicopter, splicing rig and puller from conductor pull and tension sites at the end of the power line. Each\nconductor will be pulled into place at a pre-calculated sag and then tension-clamped to the end of each\ninsulator using sag cat and static truck/tensioner equipment. The sheaves and vibration dampers and\naccessories will be removed once installation is complete. Substation areas would be excavated for the transformer equipment and control building foundation and\noil containment area. The site area for the substation would be graded and compacted to approximately\nlevel grade. Foundations for the substation would be formed with plywood and reinforced with structural\nrebar. Concrete pads would be constructed as foundations for substation equipment, and the remaining\narea would be graveled. Concrete for foundations would be brought on-site from a batching plant in\nBlythe or would be produced by a portable batch plant on site as necessary. The energy storage facility must be nearly level; therefore, the proposed BESS area would be cleared and\ngraded. Site preparation also would include construction of drainage components to capture and direct\nstormwater flow around the BESS facility. Once the concrete foundations are in place for the BESS, the\nbatteries, inverters, and other electrical equipment would be mounted and installed. Equipment would\nbe delivered to the site on trucks. 3.7. 500 kV Gen-tie Line Construction\nThe Project gen-tie line would be located within a 175-foot ROW, and would be primarily overhead, but\nundergrounding could be an option based on design constraints, existing utilities, and resources. The\noverhead gen-tie line structure foundations would be excavated to a depth of 45 feet or more and include\nconcrete supports depending on final engineering."}

Foundation sizes (permanent\ndisturbance) would be 30 to 40 feet in diameter depending on topography. The Applicant would also perform any required upgrades to the Oberon Substation during this time. 3.7.1. Helicopter Use\nHelicopters would likely be used for wire stringing activities including hanging travelers, pulling conductor\nand optical ground wire (OPGW), dead-end activities, and the installation of bird diverters for the gen-tie\nline. There would be one Helicopter Landing Zone (HLZ), likely located within a disturbed area of the\nProject site, such as in the project substation laydown yard. A water truck would be onsite to water the\nHLZ prior to helicopter activities to prevent fugitive dust from rotor wash. Helicopter refueling will be\ndone within the HLZ from a construction vehicle equipped as a fuel truck. Refueling may also occur at the\nDesert Center Airport or another regional airport, where the helicopter may be hangered overnight,\nbefore and/or after each day the helicopter is utilized. While the helicopter may land briefly within\napproved, existing disturbance areas on the gen-tie line to pick up equipment, materials, or personnel, no\nhelicopter refueling will occur on BLM-administered land. Helicopter activities would occur over a\ntemporary period within the proposed 20-month construction of the Project and would occur within the\ntypical construction hours Monday through Friday 7:00am to 7:00pm. It is estimated that helicopters\nwould be used for up to 200 hours over approximately 40 days. The helicopter activities would reduce\nground disturbance by eliminating certain on-the-ground equipment that are typically used for overhead\ngen-tie line construction, including cranes, backhoe, and trucks. Helicopter use would also reduce the\ntotal duration of gen-tie construction by approximately 10 to 15 days. A full-time avian monitor would be\nonsite for the full duration of helicopter activities to specifically monitor helicopter activities. All helicopter operations would be in accordance with a County and BLM approved Helicopter Use Plan,\nand all aircraft, pilots, linemen, and mechanics would be in full compliance with applicable Federal\nAviation Administration (FAA) requirements and standards. 3.8. Construction Access, Equipment and Traffic\nAll equipment and materials for the Project\u2019s construction would be delivered by flatbed trailers and\ntrucks. Most truck traffic would occur on designated truck routes and major streets. Project components\nwould be assembled on-site. Traffic congestion resulting from construction activities would be temporary\nand could occur along area roadways as workers commute and materials move to and from the Project\nsite."}

Post-Construction Cleanup\nConstruction sites would be kept in an orderly condition throughout the construction period by using\napproved enclosed refuse containers. All refuse and trash would be removed from the sites and disposed\nof in accordance with BLM regulations. No open burning of construction trash would occur. All vegetation\nthat may interfere with equipment would be trimmed and removed using manual non-mechanical means\nor sprayed with an approved herbicide, as necessary. 3.10. Construction Site Stabilization, Restoration and Wildlife Monitoring\nFollowing the completion of major construction, temporarily disturbed areas would be revegetated\npursuant to an approved Restoration Plan. The Plan would describe the Applicant\u2019s strategy to minimize\nadverse effects on native vegetation, soils, and habitat. Where necessary, native re-seeding or vertical\nmulching techniques to alleviate compaction would be used. However, it is anticipated that many species\nwill regenerate post-construction due to preservation of desert vegetation during the construction phase. At the conclusion of restoration activities, and if determined beneficial by USFWS, CDFW, and BLM\nbiologists, any previously relocated plants and wildlife would be reintroduced to the Project site and\nmonitored for safety and health. 3.11. Construction Water Requirements\nWater for construction needs and related dust control would be obtained from onsite or offsite\ngroundwater wells . Water tanks would likely be set up by any groundwater wells and near the O&M\nbuilding. During the construction phase, it is anticipated that a total of up to 800 acre-feet would be used for dust\nsuppression (including truck wheel washing) and other purposes during the 20-month construction\ntimeframe. During construction, restroom facilities would be provided by portable units to be serviced\nby licensed providers. 3.12. Waste Generation\nWaste would be stored in a locked container within a fenced and secure temporary staging area. As there\nwould be regulated hazardous materials onsite, storage procedures would be dictated by a Hazardous\nMaterials Plan that would be developed prior to construction. Spill prevention measures and secondary\ncontainment would be implemented as part of the Project where warranted; however, strict compliance\nunder 40 CFR 112 or Clean Water Act (CWA) Section 311 would not be required, because there would be\nno discharges to waters of the U.S. (i.e., navigable waterways or shorelines). Trucks and construction vehicles would be serviced from off-site facilities. The use, storage, transport, and\ndisposal of hazardous materials used in construction of the facility would be carried out in accordance\nwith federal, state, and county regulations."}

Vegetation would be cleared for construction of the drainage controls, including berms if needed. Con-\nstruction of the project would involve preparation, installation, and testing of electrical components such\nas cables, inverters, wiring, modules, and a transformer. Wires would be buried at a minimum of 18 inches\nbelow grade, minimizing the potential for faulty wiring to ignite a fire. All electric inverters and the trans-\nformer would be constructed on concrete foundation structures or steel skids and tested prior to use to\nensure safe operations and avoid fire risks. Prior to wire setup, work areas would be cleared of vegetation\nto reduce the risk of ignition from any vehicles or equipment. Small quantities of hazardous chemicals\nsuch as fuels and greases would be stored at the site during construction. Due to the remote location of\nthe project site, if onsite fuel tanks are utilized for equipment refueling, they are assumed to be no larger\nthan 1,000 gallons each and they would comply with all applicable regulations. All hazardous chemicals\nwould be stored in appropriate containers in an enclosed and secured location with secondary contain-\nment to prevent leakages and accidental fires.

OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE FACILITY\nUpon commissioning, the Project would enter the operations phase. The solar modules at the site would\noperate during daylight 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Operational activities at the Project site would\ninclude:\n\uf0a1 Maintaining safe and reliable solar generation. \uf0a1 Site security. \uf0a1 Responding to automated electronic alerts based on monitored data, including actual versus expected\ntolerances for system output and other key performance metrics; and\n\uf0a1 Communicating with customers, transmission system operators, and other entities involved in facility\noperations. Site standby power would be provided by backup generator(s). The California Air Resources Board (CARB)\nrequires stationary generator engines rated 50 brake-horsepower (bhp) (equivalent to 37 kW) or greater\nto obtain an air quality permit issued by the local air district. If backup generators for the substation are\n50 MW or greater, then the Applicant would obtain necessary permits, such as from the California Energy\nCommission. 4.1. Site Maintenance\nThe project site maintenance program would be largely conducted during daytime hours. Equipment\nrepairs could take place in the early morning or evening when the plant would be producing the least\namount of energy. Key program elements would include maintenance activities originating from the on-\nsite O&M facility. Maintenance typically would include panel repairs; panel washing; maintenance of transformers, inver-\nters, energy storage system, and other electrical equipment; road and fence repairs; and vegetation and\npest management. The Applicant would recondition roads up to approximately once per year, such as\nafter a heavy storm event that may cause destabilization or erosion. Revegetation would be the primary strategy to control dust across the solar facility site. Soil binders would\nbe used to control dust on roads and elsewhere on the solar facility site, as needed. On-site vegetation would be managed to ensure access to all areas of the site, reduce fire risk, and to\nassist in screening project elements as needed. Onsite vegetation may be trimmed approximately once\nevery three years, or as needed. For the first year, weed management and control in accordance with an\napproved Integrated Weed Management Plan would be performed quarterly. Solar modules would be washed as needed (up to four times each year) using light utility vehicles with\ntow-behind water trailers to maintain optimal electricity production. No chemical agents would be used\nfor module washing. No heavy equipment would be used during normal operation. O&M vehicles would include trucks (pickup\nand flatbed), forklifts, and loaders for routine and unscheduled maintenance and water trucks and/or a\nlight utility vehicle with a water trailer for solar panel washing. Large heavy-haul transport equipment may\nbe brought to the solar facility infrequently for equipment repair or replacement."}

Operation and Maintenance Workforce\nDuring operation of the proposed Project, up to 10 permanent staff could be on the site at any one time\nfor ongoing facility maintenance and repairs. Security personnel would be on-call. The staff would be\nsourced from nearby communities in Riverside County. The O&M building would house the security\nmonitoring equipment, including security camera feeds for monitoring the project 24 hours per day. 4.3. Drone Use\nDrones would be used to perform annual thermal and visual inspections of the gen-tie line and overhead\nmedium voltage collector line structures in accordance with an approved Flight Operations Plan. The\nmaximum drone operation heights would be restricted to 300 feet, which is higher than the maximum\nheight of the gen-tie line structures. Annual visual inspections are required by NERC FAC-003-4 Transmission Vegetation Management and\nutilized for preventative maintenance to reduce risk of equipment malfunction or failure. Drone inspec-\ntions will be performed once per year between September and November to avoid potential impacts to\nnesting native and migratory birds. A team of two Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved and\nUnmanned Aircraft System (UAS) certified pilots would drive a truck on gen-tie ROW access roads as close\nto the inspection sites as is safe and feasible, park on the road, and begin the inspection. The drones used\nwill be battery-powered Matrice 300 RTK or Matrice 200 series drones or similar and will perform the\ninspections between approximately 76 to 300 feet above ground level (AGL). Operating hours for inspec-\ntions would be between the hours of 10:00am and 3:00pm. The drone pilots will work in pairs with one\nflying and one spotting for safety. The use of drones for gen-tie infrastructure inspections would minimize\nthe need for larger vehicles, such as bucket trucks, and no ground disturbance would occur during drone\nuse. 4.4. O&M Water Requirements\nDuring the operations and maintenance phase, water would be required for panel washing and mainte-\nnance and for workforce facilities. Substation restroom facilities would be located adjacent to the O&M\nbuilding. If the septic system is not self-contained, an associated leach field would be required. The leach\nfield would be permitted by Riverside County and would not be located within 0.25 mile of any drinking\nwater well. For a 750-gallon septic facility, the leach field would consist of two compartments each 20\nfeet long, 2 feet high, and 4 feet wide with 10 feet of separation between the compartments. During operation, the solar array portion of the project would require the use of a total of approximately\n50 acre-feet annually for panel washing (which would occur up to four times per year) and other uses."}

All trackers could be rotated\nsimultaneously in a hazard situation. The BESS would comply with the current California Fire Code (CFC), which governs the code requirements\nto minimize the risk of fire and life safety hazards specific to battery energy storage systems used for load\nshedding, load sharing and other grid services (Chapter 12 Section 1206 of the 2019 CFC). In accordance\nwith the CFC, the battery enclosure and the site installation design are all required to be approved by the\nState Fire Marshal. If applicable, the BESS would be certified to UL 9540, the standard associated with\ncontrol, protection, power conversion, communication, controlling the system environment, air, fire\ndetection and suppression system related to the functioning of the energy storage system. The battery\nwould be tested to UL 9540A, a test method intended to document the fire characteristics associated with\nthermal event or fire and would confirm that the system will self-extinguish without active fire-fighting\nmeasures. The system would be designed, such that, during a fire event, the results of the UL 9540A test\nwould show that any internal fire is contained within the enclosure and not spread to the other parts of\nthe facility. The results of this test are used to inform facility safety system design and emergency response\nplans which would be shared with first responders. If applicable, the system would use a chemical agent\nsuppressant-based system to detect and suppress fires. If smoke or heat were detected, or if the system\nwere manually triggered, an alarm would sound, horn strobes would flash, and the system would release\nsuppressant, typically FM-200, NOVEC 1230 or a similar clean agent9 from pressurized storage cylinders. However, final safety design would follow applicable standards and would be specific to the battery\ntechnology chosen, including, but not limited to, National Fire Protection Association 855 (standard for\nthe Installation of Stationary Energy Storage Systems) and Section 1206 of the California Fire Code. In\naddition, a 10,000-gallon water tank is anticipated for each BESS unit/area. During O&M activities, standard defensible space requirements would be maintained surrounding any\nwelding or digging operations. Fire safety and suppression measures, such as smoke detectors and\nextinguishers, would be installed and available at the O&M facility, if required by the County and/or BLM. As described above, a Fire Management and Prevention Plan will be prepared in coordination with the\nCounty, BLM Fire or other emergency response organizations to identify the fire hazards and response\nscenarios that may be involved with operating the solar facility and BESS. This would include information\non response to accidents involving downed power lines or accidents involving damage to solar arrays and\nfacilities. 4.6."}

TERMINATION AND REHABILITATION\nThe facility\u2019s equipment has a useful life of 30 to 50 years. At the end of the initial power purchase agree-\nment\u2019s contract term of approximately 10 to 25 years, the Project would still be able to generate power. At that time, the facility would likely be optimized to increase the plant\u2019s efficiency by swapping out\ninverters for more efficient units, and potentially swapping out some of the facility\u2019s modules. Ground\ndisturbing work would not be necessary for optimization activities. The project would be offline for sev-\neral weeks or months during optimization activities but would subsequently continue delivering electricity\nto the wholesale market for many decades. As necessary, CUP/PUP and ROW renewals would be sought\nfrom the County and BLM, respectively. Long-term operations would be the same as described above. At the end of the Project\u2019s useful life, the solar arrays and gen-tie line would be decommissioned and\ndismantled per an agency approved Closure and Decommissioning Plan. It is assumed that\ndecommissioning would take approximately 20 months, similar to the construction duration, and would\nlikewise use up to 1,000 AF for dust suppression (including truck wheel washing) and other purposes\nduring the 20-month period. Upon ultimate decommissioning, a majority of project components will be suitable for recycling or reuse,\nand project decommissioning would be designed to optimize such salvage as circumstances allow and in\ncompliance with all local, State, and federal laws and regulations in effect at the time of decommissioning. Following removal of the above-ground and buried project components as required in the Closure and\nDecommissioning Plan, the site would be restored to its pre-solar facility conditions, or such condition as\nappropriate in accordance with County and BLM policies at the time of decommissioning. Decommissioning activities would require similar equipment and workforce as construction but would be\nsubstantially less intense. The following activities would be involved:\n\uf0a1 Dismantling and removal of all above-ground equipment (solar panels, track units, transformers,\ninverters, substation, O&M buildings, switchyard, distribution lines, etc.)\n\uf0a1 Excavation and removal of all above-ground cables\n\uf0a1 Removal of solar panel posts\n\uf0a1 Removal of primary roads (aggregate-based)\n\uf0a1 Break-up and removal of concrete pads and foundations\n\uf0a1 Removal of septic system and leach field\n\uf0a1 Removal of 34.5 kV collector lines\n\uf0a1 Dismantling of gen-tie line\n\uf0a1 Scarification of compacted areas\nThe panels could be sold into a secondary solar PV panel market, if available. The majority of the compo-\nnents of the solar installation are made of materials that can be readily recycled."}

Summary of Desktop Habitat Assessment\nA desktop habitat assessment was conducted to assess potential suitable habitat for sensitive and special\nstatus species in the Project area. The results are summarized below and have been field verified and\ndetailed in the Biological Resources Technical Report (POD Appendix G). 6.2.1. Vegetation Communities\nThe dominant communities in the Project area identified in the desktop review are:\nCreosote Bush Scrub. This is the dominant vegetation community with creosote bush (Larrea tridentata)\nas the dominant shrub canopy. This includes the creosote bush, creosote bush-burro weed, and creosote-\nburro bush vegetation alliances. This vegetation community is dominant in a majority of all the parcels. Desert Dry Wash Woodland. This is considered a sensitive vegetation community and consists of blue\npalo verde (Parkinsonia florida)-ironwood (Olneya tesota) woodland alliance with both trees as co-\ndominants in the tree or tall shrub canopy and includes the honey mesquite (Prosopsis glandulosa)\nwoodland alliance where honey mesquite is the dominant tree or tall shrub canopy. Desert dry wash\nwoodland is found in ribbons in the Project area. As discussed in Section 6.3 (Conformance with Land Use\nPlans and DRECP CMAs), the Easley Project will fully comply with all applicable DRECP CMAs on BLM-\nadministered land and private land, which includes avoidance of desert dry wash woodland habitat with\na 200-foot buffer, except for minor incursions for linear features or where there is existing intervening\ninfrastructure on private lands (CMA LUPA-BIO-RIPWET-1). Desert Pavement. The term desert pavement is primarily descriptive of soil and substrate conditions,\nrather than vegetation. It has a state rarity rank of S4 (CDFW 2021) and is often synonymous with devil\u2019s\nspineflower (Chorizanthe rigida)-hairy desert sunflower (Geraea canescens) desert pavement sparsely\nvegetated alliance. This vegetation community occurs in small patches. In accordance with CMA LUPA-\nSW-9, desert pavement has been mapped within the Project site and the extent that the Project could\ncreate erosional or ecological impacts will be evaluated in the NEPA document."}

Desert tortoise only has a\nmoderate potential for occurrence with desert tortoise predicted occupancy only higher in the\nsouthernmost portions of the Project site where previous records and more suitable habitat occurs. Avian\nspecies such as LeConte\u2019s thrasher (Toxostoma lecontei) and prairie falcon (Falco mexicanus) have a\nmoderate potential for occurrence since there is suitable foraging habitat, but no nesting habitat for\nprairie falcons. Habitat for nesting birds is present throughout the Project site, particularly in the desert dry wash\nwoodland areas. 6.3. Conformance with Land Use Plans and DRECP CMAs\nThe Easley Project is located on BLM-administered lands that are designated as DFA by the DRECP LUPA. The DRECP amended the California Desert Conservation Area (CDCA) Plan to allow for development of solar\nenergy generation and appurtenant facilities on public lands in this specific area as part of a DFA. The\nproposed solar facility is not located within any ACECs (Areas of Critical Environmental Concern) or\ndesignated recreational areas. The Chuckwalla ACEC and Chuckwalla Special Recreation Management\nArea (SRMA) are located south of I-10 in the area around the Red Bluff Substation. The Easley Project will fully comply with all applicable DRECP CMAs on BLM-administered land, as detailed\nin the consistency analysis included as POD Appendix C (Applicability of DRECP CMAs). The Applicant has\nalso voluntarily committed to complying with the DRECP CMAs on private lands within the Project area as\nwell. A portion of the Easley 500 kV gen-tie line would be sited within the Section 368 Federal Energy Corridor\n30-52, as established by the West-wide Energy Corridor (WWEC) Programmatic EIS and ROD (2009),\nwhich amended BLM land use plans to establish utility corridors for electrical transmission and other\nutility infrastructure. Corridor 30-52 was not identified as a corridor of concern. POD Appendix D, ROW\nCorridor Conflict Analysis, will be prepared during the NEPA process to demonstrate that the Project\nwould comply with the WWEC ROD. The Northern and Eastern Colorado Desert Coordinated Management (NECO) Plan also amended the\nCDCA Plan and includes management of travel routes within the project area."}

Spill Prevention and Contingency Plan\nDuring construction, all construction pickup trucks would be equipped with spill kits to clean up any\naccidental spills of fuels or lubricants. Should a major spill occur on BLM land, the Field Office would be\nnotified within 24 hours. All incidents would be properly recorded and addressed in accordance with BLM\nrequirements. 6.6. Pesticide Use Proposal\nBased on the aridity of the Project area, the overall low densities of vegetation present, and on-site veg-\netation management during O&M (see Section 6.2 above), it is not likely that vegetation would encroach\nupon structures so that access would become impaired. However, noxious weeds and other nonnative\ninvasive plant species could create a fire hazard if allowed to become established, and invasive weeds\ncould also become problematic from an ecological perspective. Therefore, weed control activities would\nbe implemented within the Project limits. Weed control activities would include both mechanical and targeted herbicide control methods, as\nnecessary. Mechanical control activities would include hand trimming with a chainsaw outside of the\ndesert tortoise active season. Non-motorized trimmers would be used in the vicinity of known sensitive\nwildlife. Herbicides may be necessary to control the spread of invasive weeds following construction as part of an\nintegrated pest management strategy. On BLM-administered land, herbicide control would involve the\ntargeted use of BLM-approved herbicides to control weed populations when manual control methods are\nnot successful in managing the spread of invasive plants, but only as reviewed and approved by USFWS\nand BLM biologists. All weed control using herbicides and adjuvants would be conducted with chemicals\napproved by BLM in California (including manufacturer application rates and use). The process for\ntreatments would be characterized in an Integrated Weed Management Plan (POD Appendix N) followed\nby a Pesticide Use Proposal (PUP) for specific chemical treatments, both approved by the BLM. In addition,\nthe Project would comply with DRECP CMA LUPA-BIO-11. 5 below identifies the herbicides proposed for\nuse on the Project site, all of which are listed in the current List of BLM-Approved Herbicides. Table 6\nidentifies the maximum and prescribed rates of herbicide application. Herbicides would be applied using\nbackpack sprayers and foliar application. Aerial spraying and truck-mounted spray rigs would not be\nutilized. Table 5."}

APPLICANT PROPOSED MEASURES AND BEST MANAGEMENT\nPRACTICES\nAPM AES-1 To reduce operational visual impacts of the Project to the Community of Lake Tamarisk,\nthe Project owner will apply a weathering coating (Natina or substantially similar) to the\nProject security fencing located closest to the Community. The coating would reduce the\noccurrence of reflectance, which would be visually distracting, and the typically earth-\ntone color of the coating would reduce the industrial character of the fencing and help it\nto blend more effectively with the surrounding landscape. The total length of fencing that\nwill be coated is approximately one mile and may be contiguous or separate sections,\ndepending on the final Project design and the location(s) of most visible security fencing. APM NOISE-1 Applicant will make best efforts to avoid or minimize use of any impact hammer for pile\ndriving or other equipment similarly capable of producing disruptive noise during con-\nstruction activities within a one-mile radius from the residential parcel on the northeast\ncorner of the Lake Tamarisk Desert Resort community during the winter months of\nhighest residency (November 1 to March 31). If based on the final construction schedule,\nuse of such equipment is necessary within this geographic area during the aforemen-\ntioned time period, the Applicant will make best efforts to avoid or minimize this con-\nstruction activity prior to 7:00 am and after 6:00 pm. The Applicant will also avoid night-\ntime equipment deliveries between 10:00pm and 7:00am. The Applicant also commits to the following best management practices (BMPs) during site preparation\nand construction. Additional BMPs identified in the Project\u2019s Fugitive Dust Control Plan would also be\nimplemented during all grading and vegetation removal activities. \uf0a1 Utilize \u2018Overland Travel\u2019 as much as possible instead of high-impact methods like disk and roll or\ngrading."}

ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED BY THE APPLICANT\n8.1. General Approach\nPrivate lands have been considered for solar development areas, but BLM-administered lands are\ngenerally preferred for siting a large-scale facility due to the relative simplicity of working with a single\npublic landowner instead of many private landowners. Therefore, the majority of the lands within the\nEasley Project area are BLM-administered lands supplemented by less than 1,000 acres of private lands\nto enable greater solar PV capacity. In addition, BLM\u2019s mandate to manage lands for multiple uses is well\nsuited to the Proponent\u2019s objectives for the Project. The site is also located within a DFA identified for\nsolar development by the DRECP LUPA. 8.2. BLM Sites Eliminated from Further Consideration\nInitially, the Applicant\u2019s application area included DFA lands within the East Riverside DFA that would be\nlocated to the east of the current Project and Highway 177/Rice Road. These areas were eliminated from\nthe Project footprint following biological resources surveys due to concerns with desert dry wash\nwoodland, active sand transport and dune vegetation, Mojave fringe-toed lizard, and high sensitivity for\ncultural and tribal resources near the Palen Dry Lake. Difficulties with compliance with the DRECP CMAs\nwould also trigger the need for a BLM Land Use Plan Amendment as part of project approval, which would\ncreate regulatory feasibility challenges. Parcels to the north of the Project area were also considered, but\nthe Applicant was unable to obtain a necessary gen-tie line easement across private lands. A discussion\nof the Project evolution is included in Section 1.2."}
