Informational Note No. 2: The selection of a properly rated\nmetal oxide arrester is based on considerations of maximum\ncontinuous operating voltage and the magnitude and duration\nof overvoltages at the arrester location as affected by phase-to-\nground faults, system grounding techniques, switching surges,\nand other causes. See the manufacturer's application rules for\nselection of the specific arrester to be used at a particular loca-\ntion. 242.44 Number Required. Where used at a point on a circuit,\na surge arrester shall be connected to each ungrounded\nconductor.

Informational Note No. 1: An important consideration for limit-\ning the imposed voltage is the routing of bonding and ground-\ning electrode conductors so that they are not any longer than\nnecessary to complete the connection without disturbing the\npermanent parts of the installation and so that unnecessary\nbends and loops are avoided. Informational Note No. 2: See NFPA 780-2020, Standard for the\nInstallation of Lightning Protection Systems, for information on\ninstallation of grounding and bonding for lightning protection\nsystems. (2) Grounding of Electrical Equipment. Normally non-\ncurrent-carrying conductive materials enclosing electrical\nconductors or equipment, or forming part of such equipment,\nshall be connected to earth so as to limit the voltage to ground\non these materials. (3) Bonding of Electrical Equipment. Normally non-current-\ncarrying conductive materials enclosing electrical conductors\nor equipment, or forming part of such equipment, shall be\nconnected together and to the electrical supply source in a\nmanner that establishes an effective ground-fault current path. (4) Bonding of Electrically Conductive Materials and Other\nEquipment. Normally non-current-carrying electrically conduc-\ntive materials that are likely to become energized shall be\nconnected together and to the electrical supply source in a\nmanner that establishes an effective ground-fault current path. (5) Effective Ground-Fault Current Path. Electrical equip-\nment and wiring and other electrically conductive material\nlikely to become energized shall be installed in a manner that\ncreates a low-impedance circuit facilitating the operation of the\novercurrent device or ground detector for impedance groun-\nded systems. It shall be capable of safely carrying the maximum\nground-fault current likely to be imposed on it from any point\non the wiring system where a ground fault occurs to the electri-\ncal supply source. The earth shall not be considered as an\neffective ground-fault current path. (B) Ungrounded Systems. (1) Grounding Electrical Equipment."}

Informational Note: See NFPA 780-2020, Standard for the Installa-\ntion of Lightning Protection Systems, for information on installation\nof grounding and bonding for lightning protection systems. (2) Bonding of Electrical Equipment. Non-current-carrying\nconductive materials enclosing electrical conductors or equip-\n ment, or forming part of such equipment, shall be connected\ntogether and to the supply system grounded equipment in a\nmanner that creates a low-impedance path for ground-fault\ncurrent that is capable of carrying the maximum fault current\nlikely to be imposed on it.

(B) Alterations to Stop Objectionable Current.

(2) Change the locations of the grounding or bonding\nconnections. (3) Interrupt the continuity of the conductor or conductive\npath causing the objectionable current. (4)\n Take other remedial and approved action. (C) Currents Not Classified as Objectionable Currents.
