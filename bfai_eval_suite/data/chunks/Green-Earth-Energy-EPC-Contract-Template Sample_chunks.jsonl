Any such reduction to the\nGuaranteed Level shall be calculated on an hourly basis based on the average generation on the applicable day\nor days when the generation loss occurs. 3.

For this test, unless otherwise agreed to in\nwriting by both Client and EPC Contractor, the photovoltaic system power, P, shall be taken to be the\nAC power at the point-of-interconnect, plane-of-array irradiance shall be measured with a photovoltaic\nreference cell, and system performance data required for the test shall be collected using the monitoring\nsystem provided with the System. Reporting conditions for the test shall be Nominal Terrestrial\nEnvironment (NTE) conditions (800 W/m2, 20 \u00b0C ambient temperature, 1 m/s wind speed) unless the\nNTE values are not encompassed by the range of actual or expected irradiance, temperature, and wind\nspeed values during the test period or inverter clipping occurs at NTE conditions, in which case\nalternate reporting conditions may be used."}

[Example:\nSunTech 280 lists its Max Power Temp Coeff as -0.47.
