Our\nequipment is designed and mfg. in the United States and performs with all inverter brands and sizes (250 / 275\n/ 350kW) presently being sold in the USA. We realize that one size does not fit all though. Thus, we have\ncrafted solutions for multiple power block / topology layouts. We illustrate this flexibility below. The following\nexamples are based on a power block size of (4.2MVA), however, block size can reduce as required to meet\nexact solar plant requirements.\nMain Switchboard / Inverters in Array / Local Disconnect\nEPEC switchboard is located at the transformer (either cable or bus\nconnected to MVT). MCCB’s in the SWBD are cabled out to\nInverters mounted throughout the array. EPEC’s 800VAC NF\ndisconnect provides required NEC local disconnecting means. Up\nto (12) 350kW inverters or up to (15) 275kW inverters are\nconnected for a total power block size of 4.2MVA. Domestic\ncontent 55-60% for SWBD. If a skidded (MVT + SWBD) solution\ndomestic content 70%.\nMain Switchboard (AC Recombiner) / Field AC Combiner\nEPEC modular (multi-section) switchboard is located at the\ntransformer (either cable or bus connected to MVT). The\nswitchboard utilizes 800VAC rated air circuit breakers ACB (800A –\n1200A). These (4) ACB’s are fed by field mounted AC combiners,\neach of which can combine up to (3) 350kW inverters or (4) 275kW\ninverters for a total power block size of 4.2MVA. Domestic content\n70%, if skidded (MVT + SWBD) or integrated rack (AC combiner +\nINV) solution domestic content 80%.\nMain Switchboard / Field Inverter Cluster with PICS 1000A\nEPEC “main breaker only” switchboard is located a the\ntransformer (either cable or bus connected to MVT). The load bus\nof the switchboard has load landing positions for up to 8x\n1000MCM cables. Inverters are clustered in the field and\ncombined with EPEC PICS 1000A fusible disconnect. Up to (4) PICS\nunits can combine up to (12) 350kW or (15) 275kW inverters for a\ntotal power block size of 4.2MVA.

        "page_content": "Arc Flash Safety Guide for Field Technicians and Engineers\n(Medium & High Voltage Systems)\n1. Introduction: Why Arc Flash Safety Matters\nArc flash is one of the most dangerous hazards in electrical work. It occurs when an\nelectrical current leaves its intended path and travels through the air between conductors\nor from a conductor to ground. The results can be catastrophic: temperatures hotter than\nthe surface of the sun, molten metal, pressure waves, shrapnel, and blinding light.\nKey risks include:\n• Severe burns (often fatal within seconds)\n• Blast pressure causing blunt trauma or ruptured eardrums\n• Flying molten copper/aluminum shrapnel penetrating PPE\n• Secondary fires and equipment damage\n• Long-term health effects: PTSD, hearing/vision loss, chronic injury\nTakeaway: No job is worth cutting corners. The best arc flash defense is awareness,\npreparation, and prevention.\n2. Arc Flash Awareness\nBefore approaching any medium- or high-voltage gear, new techs and engineers must\nunderstand:\n• Where Arc Flash Happens:\no Switchgear, switchboards, MCCs, panelboards, and transformers\no Energized busbars, circuit breakers, contactors, and disconnects\no Improperly racked breakers, corroded terminations, or failed insulation\n• Common Causes:\no Dropped tools or loose hardware",

During a morning vehicle inspection, I found one of the truck’s rear brake lights was\nout. This could have led to unsafe driving conditions, especially during long highway\nruns. The issue was reported and corrected before departure.\n2. While moving through a substation yard, I spotted a partially buried cable protruding\nabove ground. It created a trip hazard near the walkway. I flagged it with caution\ntape and reported it to site operations.\n3. A coworker attempted to lift a junction box without assistance. The weight exceeded\nsafe manual lifting limits. I stopped work and reminded the team to use a two-\nperson lift or mechanical aid.\n4. During PPE checks, a technician had a cracked face shield. This would not have\nprovided proper arc-flash protection during switching. The shield was replaced\nbefore work started.\n5. While driving to site, I observed a tech on our crew using their phone to check\ndirections. This presented a distracted driving hazard. I reminded them to use\nhands-free navigation before continuing.\n6. At a wind site, I found the turbine tower ladder fall-arrest system had a frayed\nsection of cable. I locked out the climb and called in maintenance. No climbing was\nperformed until it was corrected.\n7. While reviewing site access, a truck entered the access road too quickly, kicking up\ndust and reducing visibility. I reminded the driver about speed control and safe\napproach on unpaved roads.\n8. At the battery storage yard, a cooling fan cover was missing on one container unit.\nThis exposed sharp edges and moving parts. Work was stopped until the area was\nmade safe.\n9. A spilled cup of coffee in the control trailer created a slip hazard near the entrance. I\ncleaned the area and placed a sign until dry. Such small hazards can lead to injuries\nif not addressed.",

        "page_content": "NEP’s BDM-550 & BDM-650 White Paper\nAugust, 2025\nMicroinverters\n...to enable more power while avoiding\nsub-panel upgrade thresholds\nthese models complement the BDM-800\nideal for modules over 400Wdc\nThe residential solar industry includes a myriad of hurdles that can cause setbacks both monetarily and in meeting\ndeadlines. One major hurdle being main panel upgrades, which largely affects the smaller service ratings such as the\n100A service panels.\nWhy 100A Panels Often Need Upgrading\n• Limited capacity: A 100A panel may not support the additional load from solar back-feed, especially if the home\nalready has high electrical demand.\n• 120% Rule: NEC guidelines allow solar back-feed up to 120% of the panel rating. For a 100A panel, that’s only\n20A of allowable back-feed.\nUpgrading a service panel can cost thousands on top of an already costly PV system and can delay project completions\nweeks, even months, in some cases. NEP has a solution that is cost effective and that helps to avoid these additional\nexpenses and delayed completion timelines.\nStrategic Advantages of NEP’s BDM-550 & BDM-650 Microinverters\n• Avoids panel upgrade: By optimizing the AC output current by precise divisibility into the maximum back-feed\ncapacity, these models help stay within the 120% rule for back-feed on 100A panels.\n• Flexible system design: Dual input microinverters reduce the number of branch circuits needed, simplifying\nlayout and permitting.\n• Cost-effective scaling: Especially with the BDM-550 & BDM-650, installers can deploy more units per circuit,\nmaximizing system size without triggering main panel upgrades.",

Our\nequipment is designed and mfg. in the United States and performs with all inverter brands and sizes (250 / 275\n/ 350kW) presently being sold in the USA. We realize that one size does not fit all though. Thus, we have\ncrafted solutions for multiple power block / topology layouts. We illustrate this flexibility below. The following\nexamples are based on a power block size of (4.2MVA), however, block size can reduce as required to meet\nexact solar plant requirements.\nMain Switchboard / Inverters in Array / Local Disconnect\nEPEC switchboard is located at the transformer (either cable or bus\nconnected to MVT). MCCB’s in the SWBD are cabled out to\nInverters mounted throughout the array. EPEC’s 800VAC NF\ndisconnect provides required NEC local disconnecting means. Up\nto (12) 350kW inverters or up to (15) 275kW inverters are\nconnected for a total power block size of 4.2MVA. Domestic\ncontent 55-60% for SWBD. If a skidded (MVT + SWBD) solution\ndomestic content 70%.\nMain Switchboard (AC Recombiner) / Field AC Combiner\nEPEC modular (multi-section) switchboard is located at the\ntransformer (either cable or bus connected to MVT). The\nswitchboard utilizes 800VAC rated air circuit breakers ACB (800A –\n1200A). These (4) ACB’s are fed by field mounted AC combiners,\neach of which can combine up to (3) 350kW inverters or (4) 275kW\ninverters for a total power block size of 4.2MVA. Domestic content\n70%, if skidded (MVT + SWBD) or integrated rack (AC combiner +\nINV) solution domestic content 80%.\nMain Switchboard / Field Inverter Cluster with PICS 1000A\nEPEC “main breaker only” switchboard is located a the\ntransformer (either cable or bus connected to MVT). The load bus\nof the switchboard has load landing positions for up to 8x\n1000MCM cables. Inverters are clustered in the field and\ncombined with EPEC PICS 1000A fusible disconnect. Up to (4) PICS\nunits can combine up to (12) 350kW or (15) 275kW inverters for a\ntotal power block size of 4.2MVA. Domestic content 50%, if\nskidded (MVT + SWBD) or integrated rack (PICS + INV) solution\ndomestic content 70%+.\nElectrical Panels ∙ Engineering ∙ Controls by EPEC Solutions, Inc.\nVisit our site: www.epecsolutionsinc.com Contact: info@epecsolutionsinc.com",

        "page_content": "Arc Flash Safety Guide for Field Technicians and Engineers\n(Medium & High Voltage Systems)\n1. Introduction: Why Arc Flash Safety Matters\nArc flash is one of the most dangerous hazards in electrical work. It occurs when an\nelectrical current leaves its intended path and travels through the air between conductors\nor from a conductor to ground. The results can be catastrophic: temperatures hotter than\nthe surface of the sun, molten metal, pressure waves, shrapnel, and blinding light.\nKey risks include:\n• Severe burns (often fatal within seconds)\n• Blast pressure causing blunt trauma or ruptured eardrums\n• Flying molten copper/aluminum shrapnel penetrating PPE\n• Secondary fires and equipment damage\n• Long-term health effects: PTSD, hearing/vision loss, chronic injury\nTakeaway: No job is worth cutting corners. The best arc flash defense is awareness,\npreparation, and prevention.\n2. Arc Flash Awareness\nBefore approaching any medium- or high-voltage gear, new techs and engineers must\nunderstand:\n• Where Arc Flash Happens:\no Switchgear, switchboards, MCCs, panelboards, and transformers\no Energized busbars, circuit breakers, contactors, and disconnects\no Improperly racked breakers, corroded terminations, or failed insulation\n• Common Causes:\no Dropped tools or loose hardware",

During a morning vehicle inspection, I found one of the truck’s rear brake lights was\nout. This could have led to unsafe driving conditions, especially during long highway\nruns. The issue was reported and corrected before departure.\n2. While moving through a substation yard, I spotted a partially buried cable protruding\nabove ground. It created a trip hazard near the walkway. I flagged it with caution\ntape and reported it to site operations.\n3. A coworker attempted to lift a junction box without assistance. The weight exceeded\nsafe manual lifting limits. I stopped work and reminded the team to use a two-\nperson lift or mechanical aid.\n4. During PPE checks, a technician had a cracked face shield. This would not have\nprovided proper arc-flash protection during switching. The shield was replaced\nbefore work started.\n5. While driving to site, I observed a tech on our crew using their phone to check\ndirections. This presented a distracted driving hazard. I reminded them to use\nhands-free navigation before continuing.\n6. At a wind site, I found the turbine tower ladder fall-arrest system had a frayed\nsection of cable. I locked out the climb and called in maintenance. No climbing was\nperformed until it was corrected.\n7. While reviewing site access, a truck entered the access road too quickly, kicking up\ndust and reducing visibility. I reminded the driver about speed control and safe\napproach on unpaved roads.\n8. At the battery storage yard, a cooling fan cover was missing on one container unit.\nThis exposed sharp edges and moving parts. Work was stopped until the area was\nmade safe.\n9. A spilled cup of coffee in the control trailer created a slip hazard near the entrance. I\ncleaned the area and placed a sign until dry. Such small hazards can lead to injuries\nif not addressed.",

Incomplete information could cause confusion during shift\nhandover. The tag was corrected immediately.\n11. On the way to a solar site, our truck’s low tire pressure indicator came on. We pulled\nover and confirmed one tire was at 50% pressure. It was unsafe to continue until the\ntire was repaired.\n12. While walking a PV array row, I tripped slightly over a grounding cable that was not\nsecured tightly. This could easily cause a fall. I reported it and placed a cone until\nrepair.\n13. During inverter troubleshooting, a technician reached into the cabinet without\nvoltage testing the bus first. I stopped them and reminded them of the test-before-\ntouch rule. Work resumed safely afterward.\n14. At the EV charging site, I saw an extension cord being used across a walkway. It\nposed a trip hazard for pedestrians. I re-routed the cord overhead with a hook.\n15. While performing a harness check, I noticed one lanyard hook was cracked. Using\nthis could have resulted in fall arrest failure. The equipment was tagged out and\nreplaced.\n16. Driving through a rural access road, I saw deer crossing ahead. Quick braking\nprevented a collision, but it reinforced the need to watch wildlife in these areas. The\ncrew was reminded at tailboard.\n17. At a BESS container, a technician attempted to bypass a panel interlock. I stopped\nthe work and reinforced that interlocks must never be bypassed. The supervisor was\ninformed.\n18. While unloading tools from the truck bed, one of the ratchet straps failed. Tools\nnearly fell onto the ground and could have struck feet. Straps were replaced with\nnew ones.\n19. At the substation, I found a missing ground clamp on a portable grounding set. This\ncould compromise electrical safety. The set was removed from service immediately.\n20. A colleague reported dizziness after climbing a turbine tower. We stopped work and\nescorted them down carefully. Hydration and rest were provided before returning to\nwork.\n21. While reviewing a fire extinguisher at site, I found the gauge was in the red zone. This\nunit would not have functioned in an emergency. The extinguisher was replaced.",

        "page_content": "NEP’s BDM-550 & BDM-650 White Paper\nAugust, 2025\nMicroinverters\n...to enable more power while avoiding\nsub-panel upgrade thresholds\nthese models complement the BDM-800\nideal for modules over 400Wdc\nThe residential solar industry includes a myriad of hurdles that can cause setbacks both monetarily and in meeting\ndeadlines. One major hurdle being main panel upgrades, which largely affects the smaller service ratings such as the\n100A service panels.\nWhy 100A Panels Often Need Upgrading\n• Limited capacity: A 100A panel may not support the additional load from solar back-feed, especially if the home\nalready has high electrical demand.\n• 120% Rule: NEC guidelines allow solar back-feed up to 120% of the panel rating. For a 100A panel, that’s only\n20A of allowable back-feed.\nUpgrading a service panel can cost thousands on top of an already costly PV system and can delay project completions\nweeks, even months, in some cases. NEP has a solution that is cost effective and that helps to avoid these additional\nexpenses and delayed completion timelines.\nStrategic Advantages of NEP’s BDM-550 & BDM-650 Microinverters\n• Avoids panel upgrade: By optimizing the AC output current by precise divisibility into the maximum back-feed\ncapacity, these models help stay within the 120% rule for back-feed on 100A panels.\n• Flexible system design: Dual input microinverters reduce the number of branch circuits needed, simplifying\nlayout and permitting.\n• Cost-effective scaling: Especially with the BDM-550 & BDM-650, installers can deploy more units per circuit,\nmaximizing system size without triggering main panel upgrades.",

Up\nto (12) 350kW inverters or up to (15) 275kW inverters are\nconnected for a total power block size of 4.2MVA. Domestic\ncontent 55-60% for SWBD. If a skidded (MVT + SWBD) solution\ndomestic content 70%.\nMain Switchboard (AC Recombiner) / Field AC Combiner\nEPEC modular (multi-section) switchboard is located at the\ntransformer (either cable or bus connected to MVT). The\nswitchboard utilizes 800VAC rated air circuit breakers ACB (800A –\n1200A). These (4) ACB’s are fed by field mounted AC combiners,\neach of which can combine up to (3) 350kW inverters or (4) 275kW\ninverters for a total power block size of 4.2MVA. Domestic content\n70%, if skidded (MVT + SWBD) or integrated rack (AC combiner +\nINV) solution domestic content 80%.\nMain Switchboard / Field Inverter Cluster with PICS 1000A\nEPEC “main breaker only” switchboard is located a the\ntransformer (either cable or bus connected to MVT). The load bus\nof the switchboard has load landing positions for up to 8x\n1000MCM cables. Inverters are clustered in the field and\ncombined with EPEC PICS 1000A fusible disconnect. Up to (4) PICS\nunits can combine up to (12) 350kW or (15) 275kW inverters for a\ntotal power block size of 4.2MVA.

Our\nequipment is designed and mfg. in the United States and performs with all inverter brands and sizes (250 / 275\n/ 350kW) presently being sold in the USA. We realize that one size does not fit all though. Thus, we have\ncrafted solutions for multiple power block / topology layouts. We illustrate this flexibility below. The following\nexamples are based on a power block size of (4.2MVA), however, block size can reduce as required to meet\nexact solar plant requirements.\nMain Switchboard / Inverters in Array / Local Disconnect\nEPEC switchboard is located at the transformer (either cable or bus\nconnected to MVT). MCCB’s in the SWBD are cabled out to\nInverters mounted throughout the array. EPEC’s 800VAC NF\ndisconnect provides required NEC local disconnecting means. Up\nto (12) 350kW inverters or up to (15) 275kW inverters are\nconnected for a total power block size of 4.2MVA. Domestic\ncontent 55-60% for SWBD. If a skidded (MVT + SWBD) solution\ndomestic content 70%.\nMain Switchboard (AC Recombiner) / Field AC Combiner\nEPEC modular (multi-section) switchboard is located at the\ntransformer (either cable or bus connected to MVT). The\nswitchboard utilizes 800VAC rated air circuit breakers ACB (800A –\n1200A). These (4) ACB’s are fed by field mounted AC combiners,\neach of which can combine up to (3) 350kW inverters or (4) 275kW\ninverters for a total power block size of 4.2MVA. Domestic content\n70%, if skidded (MVT + SWBD) or integrated rack (AC combiner +\nINV) solution domestic content 80%.\nMain Switchboard / Field Inverter Cluster with PICS 1000A\nEPEC “main breaker only” switchboard is located a the\ntransformer (either cable or bus connected to MVT). The load bus\nof the switchboard has load landing positions for up to 8x\n1000MCM cables. Inverters are clustered in the field and\ncombined with EPEC PICS 1000A fusible disconnect. Up to (4) PICS\nunits can combine up to (12) 350kW or (15) 275kW inverters for a\ntotal power block size of 4.2MVA. Domestic content 50%, if\nskidded (MVT + SWBD) or integrated rack (PICS + INV) solution\ndomestic content 70%+.\nElectrical Panels ∙ Engineering ∙ Controls by EPEC Solutions, Inc.\nVisit our site: www.epecsolutionsinc.com Contact: info@epecsolutionsinc.com",
