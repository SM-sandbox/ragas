MOLDED CASE 
CIRCUIT BREAKERS
What’s new 
in molded case 
circuit breakers:
New! 3-Pole GFCI (5mA and 30mA)
Siemens introduces the new 3-pole GFCI, expanding their 
commercial GFCI line to enhance safety in demanding 
applications. The 3-pole GFCI is available in Bolt-on 
configuration now, with Cable-in/Cable-out coming soon.
New 3VA Large Frame up to 2000A 
n	Full suite of external accessories including  
connection technology, mounting bases, external 
breaker operators, interlocks and test devices.
n	UL 100% ratings available in 1200A and 1600A 
frame sizes – TMTU & ETU
n	DAS+ Arc Energy Reduction as a standard  
feature in all ETU versions – US National Electric 
Code compliant.
n	Mechanical platform is based on predecessor 
3VL design with 25 years of installed base and 
proven best-in-class reliability. As a result,  
footprint is nearly identical as 3VL7 (NG) and 
3VL8 (PG) MCCBs allowing for simple upgrade  
to 3VA in existing electrical apparatus.
The Dual Function Circuit Breaker combines 
GFCI and AFCI, protecting against both Arc 
Faults and Ground Faults. This, along with the 
new Self-Test & Lockout feature, makes it the 
first in class in electrical safety for homeowners.
n	Faster Installation
n	Cost savings
n	Smaller Device
n	Self Test & Lockout feature as required by 
UL 943 effective June 2015
Molded Case Circuit Breakers

The new 
Siemens  
3VA molded 
case circuit 
breakers
The Siemens 3VA41 circuit breaker is a compact, 
industrial design thermal magnetic breaker with 
features which include a design that meets multi-
national standards (UL, NOM, EAC), available with 
NAVAL ratings which meet UL489 Supplement 
SB, and an extensive selection of UL listed, field 
installable internal accessories (auxillary and alarm 
switches, shunt and undervoltage trips). The 3VA41 
is available from 15A to 125A in 1, 1 in 2-pole, 2 or 
3-pole versions on 1 inch pole centers having AC 
interrupting ratings up to 65KA @ 480VAC and 25KA 
@ 600Y347V and DC ratings up to 100KA @ 250VDC.

Ordering
The 3VA breakers are shipped complete 
with non-interchangeable trip units and 
without lugs.
The 3VA41 panelboard mounted circuit 
breakers are shipped with aluminum load 
side lugs installed as standard.
3VA51 through 3VA55 thermal-
magnetic trip breakers as well as 
3VA61 through 3VA66 electronic trip 
breakers are shipped as standard 
without lugs installed. To order factory 
installed nut keepers, which are 
required for installation in panelboards 
or switchboards, the 12th digit of the 
catalog should be change to "2" when 
ordering. (For example, a 35KA@480VAC, 
40A, 3-pole, 3VA51 with lugs would be 
catalog number 3VA5140-5ED32-0AA0).
To order factory installed standard line 
and load lugs, the 12th digit of the 
catalog number should be changed to 
"6" (standard lugs are identified in the 
respective lug tables and footnotes 
in the SpeedFax). (For example, a 
35KA@480VAC, 40A, 3-pole, 3VA51  
with lugs would be catalog number 
3VA5140-5ED36-0AA0). Alternate 
connectors can be ordered separately  
for field installation.
All 3VA6 circuit breakers are certified 
to UL 489 Supplement SB, are marked 
“NAVAL”, and are suitable for use at 
50C.
To order NAVAL-rated thermal-magnetic 
trip circuit breakers, the 13th digit of 
the catalog number should be changed 
to the number "1". (For example, a 
35KA @480VAC, 40A, 3-pole, NAVAL 
rated 3VA51 would be catalog number 
3VA5140-5ED31-1AA0).
All 3VA5 thermal-magnetic trip and 3VA6 
electronic trip circuit breakers are UL 
listed for reverse feed applications.
 
Connecting Breakers for DC 
Application
Most Siemens thermal magnetic trip 
MCCBs are applicable on direct current 
(dc) systems. Generally, for 250 V dc  
systems a two pole breaker is used,  
with one pole on each leg of the supply 
circuit. For three pole breakers applied on 
500 V undergrounded DC systems, it is 
important to connect the power supply 
“zig-zag” through the breaker as shown 
in the figure below. This assures that the 
Voltage between phases on the breaker 
terminals is uniformly distributed.
See below for an alternative connection 
diagram. For a list of 3VA5 breakers  
with the DC ratings, please refer to 
pages 7-10 to 7-11.

Note:
(A) Molded case circuit breakers are designed and tested  
in accordance to applicable portions of UL489 and meet  
application requirements of the National Electric Code.  
Unless marked otherwise, circuit breakers are 80% duty rated.
(B) Molded case circuit breakers are to be connected with 60 or 
75°C wire for circuit breakers having a rated ampacity of  
100 amperes or less. Circuit breakers having a rated ampacity 
greater than 100 amperes shall only be cabled with 75°C  
cable unless otherwise indicated on the circuit breaker  
label. Exceptions to this rule are outlined in the article  
110-14 C(1)(2) of the 2005 National Electric Code.
a	Interrupting ratings are not limited to the values or 
groups of values listed. However, the values listed are 
minimum values for the class specified.
b	Single-unit or duplex construction must be specified.
c	Use minimum frame size for ampere rating.
d	BT and BTH are only available in 15A and 20A with two 
1-pole circuits in one inch of unit space. BT and BTH 
series breakers can be used in any Siemens panelboard 
in positions that accept BL or BLH series breakers. It 
is the installers responsibility to ensure that there is 
adequate neutral connections available in the panel 
before installing these breakers.
