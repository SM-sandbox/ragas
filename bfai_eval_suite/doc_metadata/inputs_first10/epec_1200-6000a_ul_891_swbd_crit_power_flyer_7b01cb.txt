Ample Power Capacity
Our 6000A SWBD delivers the power capacity you 
need, ensuring your center or other critical 
requirement can handle the most demanding 
workloads. With the ability to manage high 
currents, this SWBD is built to support the robust 
needs of large scale applications.
Intelligence for Diagnostics, Metering, 
& Switching
Our SWBD’s utilize Siemens’ 
state-of-the-art power (3WA) and 
molded case (3VA6) circuit breakers. 
Full metering and diagnostics for each 
circuit is available from advanced trip 
units. Information is easily made 
available to via Modbus TCP or other 
ethernet / PLC protocol. If advanced 
communication is not required 
standard trip units are available.
