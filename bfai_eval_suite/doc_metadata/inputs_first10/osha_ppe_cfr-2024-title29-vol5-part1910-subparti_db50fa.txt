including personal protective equip-
ment for eyes, face, head, and extrem-
ities, protective clothing, respiratory 
devices, and protective shields and bar-
riers, shall be provided, used, and 
maintained in a sanitary and reliable 
condition wherever it is necessary by 
reason of hazards of processes or envi-
ronment, 
chemical 
hazards, 
radio-
logical hazards, or mechanical irri-
tants encountered in a manner capable 
of causing injury or impairment in the 
function of any part of the body 
through

equipment shall be of safe design and 
construction for the work to be per-
formed. 
(d) Hazard assessment and equipment 
selection. (1) The employer shall assess 
the workplace to determine if hazards 
are present, or are likely to be present, 
which necessitate the use of personal 
protective equipment (PPE). If such 
hazards are present, or likely to be 
present, the employer shall: 
(i) Select, and have each affected em-
ployee use, the types of PPE that will 
protect the affected employee from the 
hazards identified in the hazard assess-
ment; 
(ii) Communicate selection decisions 
to each affected employee; and, 
(iii) Select PPE that properly fits 
each affected employee. 
NOTE: Non-mandatory appendix B contains 
an example of procedures that would comply 
with the requirement for a hazard assess-
ment. 
(2) The employer shall verify that the 
required workplace hazard assessment 
has been performed through a written 
certification that identifies the work-
place evaluated; the person certifying 
that the evaluation has been per-
formed; the date(s) of the hazard as-
sessment; and, which identifies the 
document as a certification of hazard 
assessment. 
(e) Defective and damaged equipment. 
Defective or damaged personal protec-
tive equipment shall not be used. 
(f) Training. (1) The employer shall 
provide training to each employee who 
is required by this section to use PPE.

(2) Each affected employee shall dem-
onstrate an understanding of the train-
ing specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this 
section, and the ability to use PPE 
properly, before being allowed to per-
form work requiring the use of PPE. 
(3) When the employer has reason to 
believe that any affected employee who 
has already been trained does not have 
the understanding and skill required by 
paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the em-
ployer shall retrain each such em-
ployee. Circumstances where retrain-
ing is required include, but are not lim-
ited to, situations where: 
(i) Changes in the workplace render 
previous training obsolete; or 
(ii) Changes in the types of PPE to be 
used render previous training obsolete; 
or 
(iii) Inadequacies in an affected em-
ployee’s knowledge or use of assigned 
PPE indicate that the employee has 
not 
retained 
the 
requisite 
under-
standing or skill. 
(g) Paragraphs (d) and (f) of this sec-
tion apply only to §§ 1910.133, 1910.135,

sonal protective equipment (PPE), used 
to comply with this part, shall be pro-
vided by the employer at no cost to 
employees. 
(2) The employer is not required to 
pay for non-specialty safety-toe protec-
tive footwear (including steel-toe shoes 
or steel-toe boots) and non-specialty 
prescription safety eyewear, provided 
that the employer permits such items 
to be worn off the job-site. 
(3) 
When 
the 
employer 
provides 
metatarsal guards and allows the em-
ployee, at his or her request, to use 
shoes or boots with built-in metatarsal 
protection, the employer is not re-
quired to reimburse the employee for 
the shoes or boots. 
(4) The employer is not required to 
pay for: 
(i) The logging boots required by 29 
CFR 1910.266(d)(1)(v); 
(ii) Everyday clothing, such as long- 
sleeve shirts, long pants, street shoes,

placement PPE, except when the em-
ployee has lost or intentionally dam-
aged the PPE. 
(6) Where an employee provides ade-
quate protective equipment he or she 
owns pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
section, the employer may allow the 
employee to use it and is not required 
to reimburse the employee for that

* As a rule of thumb, start with a shade that is too dark to see the weld zone. Then go to a 
lighter shade which gives sufficient view of the weld zone without going below the minimum. In 
oxyfuel gas welding or cutting where the torch produces a high yellow light, it is desirable to use 
a filter lens that absorbs the yellow or sodium line in the visible light of the (spectrum) operation. 
** These values apply where the actual arc is clearly seen. Experience has shown that lighter 
filters may be used when the arc is hidden by the workpiece. 
(b) Criteria for protective eye and face 
protection. (1) Protective eye and face 
protection devices must comply with 
any of the following consensus stand-
ards: 
(i) ANSI/ISEA Z87.1–2010, Occupa-
tional and Educational Personal Eye 
and Face Protection Devices, incor-
porated by reference in § 1910.6; 
(ii) ANSI Z87.1–2003, Occupational 
and Educational Personal Eye and 
Face Protection Devices, incorporated 
by reference in § 1910.6; or 
(iii) ANSI Z87.1–1989 (R–1998), Prac-
tice for Occupational and Educational 
Eye and Face Protection, incorporated 
by reference in § 1910.6; 
(2) Protective eye and face protection 
devices 
that 
the 
employer 
dem-
onstrates are at least as effective as 
protective eye and face protection de-
vices that are constructed in accord-
ance with one of the above consensus 
standards will be deemed to be in com-
pliance with the requirements of this 
section.

This section applies to General In-
dustry (part 1910), Shipyards (part 
1915), Marine Terminals (part 1917), 
Longshoring (part 1918), and Construc-
tion (part 1926). 
(a) Permissible practice. (1) In the con-
trol of those occupational diseases 
caused by breathing air contaminated 
with harmful dusts, fogs, fumes, mists, 
gases, smokes, sprays, or vapors, the 
primary objective shall be to prevent 
atmospheric contamination. This shall 
be accomplished as far as feasible by 
accepted engineering control measures 
(for example, enclosure or confinement 
of the operation, general and local ven-
tilation, and substitution of less toxic 
materials). When effective engineering 
controls are not feasible, or while they 
are being instituted, appropriate res-
pirators shall be used pursuant to this 
section. 
(2) A respirator shall be provided to 
each employee when such equipment is 
necessary to protect the health of such 
employee. The employer shall provide 
the respirators which are applicable 
and suitable for the purpose intended. 
The employer shall be responsible for 
the establishment and maintenance of 
a 
respiratory 
protection 
program, 
which shall include the requirements 
outlined in paragraph (c) of this sec-
tion. The program shall cover each em-
ployee required by this section to use a 
respirator. 
(b) Definitions. The following defini-
tions are important terms used in the 
respiratory protection standard in this

ards associated with the use of the res-
pirator. The Small Entity Compliance 
Guide contains criteria for the selec-
tion of a program administrator and a 
sample program that meets the re-
quirements of this paragraph. Copies of

Occu. Safety and Health Admin., Labor 
§ 1910.134 
shall include in the program the fol-
lowing provisions of this section, as ap-
plicable: 
(i) 
Procedures 
for 
selecting 
res-
pirators for use in the workplace; 
(ii) Medical evaluations of employees 
required to use respirators; 
(iii) Fit testing procedures for tight- 
fitting respirators; 
(iv) Procedures for proper use of res-
pirators in routine and reasonably fore-
seeable emergency situations; 
(v) Procedures and schedules for 
cleaning, disinfecting, storing, inspect-
ing, repairing, discarding, and other-
wise maintaining respirators; 
(vi) Procedures to ensure adequate 
air quality, quantity, and flow of 
breathing air for atmosphere-supplying 
respirators; 
(vii) Training of employees in the 
respiratory hazards to which they are 
potentially exposed during routine and 
emergency situations; 
(viii) Training of employees in the 
proper use of respirators, including 
putting on and removing them, any 
limitations on their use, and their 
maintenance; and 
(ix) Procedures for regularly evalu-
ating the effectiveness of the program. 
(2) Where respirator use is not re-
quired: 
(i) An employer may provide res-
pirators at the request of employees or 
permit employees to use their own res-
pirators, if the employer determines 
that such respirator use will not in 
itself create a hazard. If the employer 
determines that any voluntary res-
pirator use is permissible, the em-
ployer shall provide the respirator 
users with the information contained 
in appendix D to this section (‘‘Infor-
mation 
for 
Employees 
Using 
Res-
pirators When Not Required Under the 
Standard’’); and 
(ii) In addition, the employer must 
establish and implement those ele-
ments of a written respiratory protec-
tion program necessary to ensure that 
any employee using a respirator volun-
tarily is medically able to use that res-
pirator, and that the respirator is 
cleaned, stored, and maintained so that 
its use does not present a health hazard 
to the user. Exception: Employers are 
not required to include in a written 
respiratory protection program those 
employees whose only use of res-
pirators involves the voluntary use of 
filtering facepieces (dust masks). 
(3) The employer shall designate a 
program administrator who is qualified 
by appropriate training or experience 
that is commensurate with the com-
plexity of the program to administer or 
oversee the respiratory protection pro-
gram and conduct the required evalua-
tions of program effectiveness. 
(4) The employer shall provide res-
pirators, training, and medical evalua-
tions at no cost to the employee. 
(d) Selection of respirators. This para-
graph requires the employer to evalu-
ate respiratory hazard(s) in the work-
place, identify relevant workplace and 
user factors, and base respirator selec-
tion on these factors. The paragraph 
also specifies appropriately protective 
respirators 
for 
use 
in 
IDLH 
atmospheres, and limits the selection 
and use of air-purifying respirators. 
(1) General requirements. (i) The em-
ployer shall select and provide an ap-
propriate respirator based on the res-
piratory hazard(s) to which the worker 
is exposed and workplace and user fac-
tors that affect respirator performance 
and reliability. 
(ii) The employer shall select a 
NIOSH-certified respirator. The res-
pirator shall be used in compliance 
with the conditions of its certification. 
(iii) The employer shall identify and 
evaluate the respiratory hazard(s) in 
the workplace; this evaluation shall in-
clude a reasonable estimate of em-
ployee exposures to respiratory haz-
ard(s) and an identification of the con-
taminant’s chemical state and physical 
form. Where the employer cannot iden-
tify or reasonably estimate the em-
ployee exposure, the employer shall 
consider the atmosphere to be IDLH. 
(iv) The employer shall select res-
pirators from a sufficient number of 
respirator models and sizes so that the 
respirator is acceptable to, and cor-
rectly fits, the user. 
(2) Respirators for IDLH atmospheres. 
(i) The employer shall provide the fol-
lowing respirators for employee use in 
IDLH atmospheres: 
(A) A full facepiece pressure demand 
SCBA certified by NIOSH for a min-
imum service life of thirty minutes, or

(B) A combination full facepiece pres-
sure demand supplied-air respirator 
(SAR) with auxiliary self-contained air 
supply. 
(ii) Respirators provided only for es-
cape from IDLH atmospheres shall be 
NIOSH-certified for escape from the at-
mosphere in which they will be used. 
(iii) 
All 
oxygen-deficient 
atmospheres shall be considered IDLH. 
Exception: 
If 
the 
employer 
dem-
onstrates that, under all foreseeable 
conditions, the oxygen concentration 
can be maintained within the ranges 
specified in Table II of this section 
(i.e., for the altitudes set out in the 
table), then any atmosphere-supplying 
respirator may be used. 
(3) Respirators for atmospheres that are 
not IDLH. (i) The employer shall pro-
vide a respirator that is adequate to 
protect the health of the employee and 
ensure compliance with all other OSHA 
statutory and regulatory requirements, 
under routine and reasonably foresee-
able emergency situations. 
(A) Assigned Protection Factors (APFs). 
Employers must use the assigned pro-
tection factors listed in Table 1 to se-
lect a respirator that meets or exceeds 
the required level of employee protec-
tion. When using a combination res-
pirator (e.g., airline respirators with an 
air-purifying filter), employers must 
ensure that the assigned protection 
factor is appropriate to the mode of op-
eration in which the respirator is being 
used.

Notes: 
1 Employers may select respirators assigned for use in higher workplace concentrations of a hazardous substance for use at 
lower concentrations of that substance, or when required respirator use is independent of concentration. 
2 The assigned protection factors in Table 1 are only effective when the employer implements a continuing, effective respirator 
program as required by this section (29 CFR 1910.134), including training, fit testing, maintenance, and use requirements. 
3 This APF category includes filtering facepieces, and half masks with elastomeric facepieces. 
4 The employer must have evidence provided by the respirator manufacturer that testing of these respirators demonstrates per-
formance at a level of protection of 1,000 or greater to receive an APF of 1,000. This level of performance can best be dem-
onstrated by performing a WPF or SWPF study or equivalent testing. Absent such testing, all other PAPRs and SARs with hel-
mets/hoods are to be treated as loose-fitting facepiece respirators, and receive an APF of 25. 
5 These APFs do not apply to respirators used solely for escape. For escape respirators used in association with specific sub-
stances covered by 29 CFR 1910 subpart Z, employers must refer to the appropriate substance-specific standards in that sub-
part. Escape respirators for other IDLH atmospheres are specified by 29 CFR 1910.134 (d)(2)(ii). 
(B) 
Maximum 
Use 
Concentration 
(MUC). (1) The employer must select a 
respirator for employee use that main-
tains the employee’s exposure to the 
hazardous substance, when measured 
outside the respirator, at or below the 
MUC. 
(2) Employers must not apply MUCs 
to conditions that are immediately 
dangerous to life or health (IDLH); in-
stead, they must use respirators listed 
for IDLH conditions in paragraph (d)(2) 
of this standard. 
(3) When the calculated MUC exceeds 
the IDLH level for a hazardous sub-
stance, or the performance limits of 
the cartridge or canister, then employ-
ers must set the maximum MUC at 
that lower limit. 
(ii) The respirator selected shall be 
appropriate for the chemical state and 
physical form of the contaminant. 
(iii) For protection against gases and 
vapors, the employer shall provide: 
(A) An atmosphere-supplying res-
pirator, or 
(B) An air-purifying respirator, pro-
vided that:

(1) The respirator is equipped with an 
end-of-service-life indicator (ESLI) cer-
tified by NIOSH for the contaminant; 
or 
(2) If there is no ESLI appropriate for 
conditions in the employer’s work-
place, the employer implements a 
change schedule for canisters and car-
tridges that is based on objective infor-
mation or data that will ensure that 
canisters and cartridges are changed 
before the end of their service life. The 
employer shall describe in the res-
pirator program the information and 
data relied upon and the basis for the 
canister and cartridge change schedule 
and the basis for reliance on the data. 
(iv) For protection against particu-
lates, the employer shall provide: 
(A) An atmosphere-supplying res-
pirator; or 
(B) 
An 
air-purifying 
respirator 
equipped with a filter certified by 
NIOSH under 30 CFR part 11 as a high

ticulates by NIOSH under 42 CFR part 
84; or 
(C) For contaminants consisting pri-
marily of particles with mass median 
aerodynamic diameters (MMAD) of at 
least 2 micrometers, an air-purifying 
respirator equipped with any filter cer-
tified for particulates by NIOSH.

(e) Medical evaluation. Using a res-
pirator may place a physiological bur-
den on employees that varies with the 
type of respirator worn, the job and 
workplace conditions in which the res-
pirator is used, and the medical status 
of the employee. Accordingly, this 
paragraph specifies the minimum re-
quirements for medical evaluation that 
employers must implement to deter-
mine the employee’s ability to use a 
respirator. 
(1) General. The employer shall pro-
vide a medical evaluation to determine 
the employee’s ability to use a res-
pirator, before the employee is fit test-
ed or required to use the respirator in 
the workplace. The employer may dis-
continue an employee’s medical eval-
uations when the employee is no longer 
required to use a respirator. 
(2) Medical evaluation procedures. (i) 
The employer shall identify a physi-
cian or other licensed health care pro-
fessional (PLHCP) to perform medical 
evaluations using a medical question-
naire or an initial medical examination 
that obtains the same information as 
the medical questionnaire. 
(ii) The medical evaluation shall ob-
tain the information requested by the 
questionnaire in Sections 1 and 2, part 
A of appendix C of this section. 
(3) Follow-up medical examination. (i) 
The employer shall ensure that a fol-
low-up medical examination is pro-
vided for an employee who gives a posi-
tive response to any question among 
questions 1 through 8 in Section 2, part 
A of appendix C or whose initial med-
ical 
examination 
demonstrates 
the 
need for a follow-up medical examina-
tion. 
(ii) The follow-up medical examina-
tion shall include any medical tests, 
consultations, or diagnostic procedures 
that the PLHCP deems necessary to 
make a final determination. 
(4) Administration of the medical ques-
tionnaire and examinations. (i) The med-
ical questionnaire and examinations 
shall be administered confidentially 
during the employee’s normal working 
hours or at a time and place conven-
ient to the employee. The medical 
questionnaire shall be administered in 
a manner that ensures that the em-
ployee understands its content. 
(ii) The employer shall provide the 
employee with an opportunity to dis-
cuss the questionnaire and examina-
tion results with the PLHCP. 
(5) Supplemental information for the 
PLHCP. (i) The following information 
must be provided to the PLHCP before 
the PLHCP makes a recommendation

29 CFR Ch. XVII (7–1–24 Edition) 
§ 1910.134 
concerning an employee’s ability to use 
a respirator: 
(A) The type and weight of the res-
pirator to be used by the employee; 
(B) The duration and frequency of 
respirator use (including use for rescue 
and escape); 
(C) The expected physical work ef-
fort; 
(D) Additional protective clothing 
and equipment to be worn; and 
(E) Temperature and humidity ex-
tremes that may be encountered. 
(ii) Any supplemental information 
provided previously to the PLHCP re-
garding an employee need not be pro-
vided for a subsequent medical evalua-
tion if the information and the PLHCP 
remain the same. 
(iii) The employer shall provide the 
PLHCP with a copy of the written res-
piratory protection program and a 
copy of this section. 
NOTE
TO
PARAGRAPH (e)(5)(iii): When the 
employer replaces a PLHCP, the employer 
must ensure that the new PLHCP obtains 
this information, either by providing the 
documents directly to the PLHCP or having 
the documents transferred from the former 
PLHCP to the new PLHCP. However, OSHA 
does not expect employers to have employees 
medically reevaluated solely because a new 
PLHCP has been selected. 
(6) Medical determination. In deter-
mining the employee’s ability to use a 
respirator, the employer shall: 
(i) Obtain a written recommendation 
regarding the employee’s ability to use 
the respirator from the PLHCP. The 
recommendation shall provide only the 
following information: 
(A) Any limitations on respirator use 
related to the medical condition of the 
employee, or relating to the workplace 
conditions in which the respirator will 
be used, including whether or not the 
employee is medically able to use the 
respirator; 
(B) The need, if any, for follow-up 
medical evaluations; and 
(C) A statement that the PLHCP has 
provided the employee with a copy of 
the PLHCP’s written recommendation. 
(ii) If the respirator is a negative 
pressure respirator and the PLHCP 
finds a medical condition that may 
place the employee’s health at in-
creased risk if the respirator is used, 
the employer shall provide a PAPR if 
the PLHCP’s medical evaluation finds 
that the employee can use such a res-
pirator; if a subsequent medical eval-
uation finds that the employee is medi-
cally able to use a negative pressure 
respirator, then the employer is no 
longer required to provide a PAPR. 
(7) Additional medical evaluations. At a 
minimum, the employer shall provide 
additional medical evaluations that 
comply with the requirements of this 
section if: 
(i) An employee reports medical signs 
or symptoms that are related to ability 
to use a respirator; 
(ii) A PLHCP, supervisor, or the res-
pirator program administrator informs 
the employer that an employee needs 
to be reevaluated; 
(iii) Information from the respiratory 
protection program, including observa-
tions made during fit testing and pro-
gram evaluation, indicates a need for 
employee reevaluation; or 
(iv) A change occurs in workplace 
conditions (e.g., physical work effort, 
protective clothing, temperature) that 
may result in a substantial increase in 
the physiological burden placed on an 
employee. 
(f) Fit testing. This paragraph requires 
that, before an employee may be re-
quired to use any respirator with a 
negative or positive pressure tight-fit-
ting facepiece, the employee must be 
fit tested with the same make, model, 
style, and size of respirator that will be 
used. This paragraph specifies the 
kinds of fit tests allowed, the proce-
dures for conducting them, and how 
the results of the fit tests must be 
used. 
(1) The employer shall ensure that 
employees using a tight-fitting face-
piece respirator pass an appropriate 
qualitative fit test (QLFT) or quan-
titative fit test (QNFT) as stated in 
this paragraph. 
(2) The employer shall ensure that an 
employee using a tight-fitting face-
piece respirator is fit tested prior to 
initial use of the respirator, whenever 
a different respirator facepiece (size, 
style, model or make) is used, and at 
least annually thereafter. 
(3) The employer shall conduct an ad-
ditional fit test whenever the employee 
reports, or the employer, PLHCP, su-
pervisor, or program administrator
