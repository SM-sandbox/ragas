100/125kW, 1500Vdc String Inverters for North America
The 100 & 125kW high power CPS three phase string inverters are designed for ground mount applications.  The units are high 
performance, advanced and reliable inverters designed specifically for the North American environment and grid.  High efficiency 
at 99.1% peak and 98.5% CEC, wide operating voltages, broad temperature ranges and a NEMA Type 4X enclosure enable this 
inverter platform to operate at high performance across many applications.  The CPS 100/125kW products ship with the Standard 
or Centralized Wire-box, each fully integrated and separable with AC and DC disconnect switches.  The Standard Wire-box inlcudes 
touch safe fusing for up to 20 strings.  The CPS Flex Gateway enables communication, controls and remote product upgrades.
  NFPA 70, NEC 2014 and 2017 compliant
  Touch safe DC Fuse holders adds convenience and safety
  CPS Flex Gateway enables remote FW upgrades
  Integrated AC & DC disconnect switches
  1 MPPT with 20 fused inputs for maximum flexibility
  Copper and Aluminum compatible AC connections
