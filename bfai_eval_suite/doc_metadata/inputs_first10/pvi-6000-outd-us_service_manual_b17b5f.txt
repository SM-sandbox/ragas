USEFUL INFORMATION AND SAFETY STANDARD 
 
FOREWORD 
¾ The installation of Aurora must be performed in full compliance with national and 
local standards and regulations 
¾ AURORA has no spare parts to replace. 
For any maintenance or repair please contact the nearest authorized repair center. 
Please contact your reseller if you need to know the nearest authorized repair 
center. 
¾ Read and understand all the instructions contained in this manual and become 
familiar with the safety symbols in the relevant paragraphs before you install and 
commission the equipment 
¾ The connection to the distribution grid must be done only after receiving approval 
from the distribution utility as required by national and state interconnection 
regulations, and can be done only by qualified personnel. 
¾ Cover the photovoltaic panels with dark opaque sheets before they are connected 
to avoid any chance of high voltages to appear at the connecting cable 
terminations. 
 
GENERAL 
During inverter operation, some parts can be powered, some not properly insulated 
and, in some cases, some parts can move or rotate, or some surfaces be hot. 
Unauthorized removal of the necessary protections, improper use, wrong installation 
or wrong operation may lead to serious damage to people and objects.  
Transport, handling, installation, commissioning and maintenance must be performed 
by qualified and trained personnel (all accident prevention rules in force in the user's 
country must be observed ! ! !). 
According to these basic safety rules, qualified and trained people have skills for the 
assembling, start-up and operation of the product, as well as the necessary 
requirements and qualifications to perform such operations.

ASSEMBLY 
Devices shall be assembled and cooled according to the specifications mentioned in 
the corresponding documents.  
In particular, during transport and handling, parts shall not be bent and/or the 
insulation distances shall not be changed. There should be no contact between 
electronic parts and connection terminals. 
Electrical parts must not be mechanically damaged or destroyed (potential health risk). 
ELECTRICAL CONNECTION 
With the inverter powered, comply with all prevailing national regulations on 
accidents prevention. 
Electrical connections shall be carried out in accordance with the applicable 
regulations, such as conductor sections, fuses, PE connection.  
OPERATION 
Systems with inverters shall be provided with further control and protective devices in 
compliance with the corresponding prevailing safety rules, such as those relating to the 
compliance with technical equipment, accident-preventing regulations, etc. Any 
calibration change shall be made using the operational software. Once the inverter has 
been disconnected from the power grid, powered parts and electrical connections shall 
not be touched as some capacitors could be charged. Comply with all corresponding 
marks and symbols present on each device. During operation, make sure that all covers 
and doors are closed.  
MAINTENANCE AND SERVICE 
Comply with manufacturer’s recommendations.

FOREWORD 
This document contains a technical description of AURORA photovoltaic inverter so 
as to provide the installer and user all the necessary information about installation, 
operation and use of AURORA. 
1.1 
PHOTOVOLTAIC ENERGY 
Industrialized countries (greater energy consumers) have been experimenting energy-
saving methods and reduced pollutant levels for many years thanks to the energy-
conversion process. This may be possible through a shrewd and rational consumption 
of well-known resources, and also by looking for new forms of clean and not 
exhaustible energy. 
Regenerating sources of energy are fundamental to solve this problem. Under these 
circumstances, solar energy exploitation to generate electrical (photovoltaic) energy is 
becoming more and more important worldwide. 
Photovoltaic energy, in any case, is of great advantage to the environment because the 
radiated energy we receive from the sun is transformed directly into electrical energy 
without any combustion process and without producing any pollution.
