Solar inverters 
ABB string inverters
PVI-5000/6000-TL-OUTD
5kW to 6kW
Designed for residential and small 
commercial PV installations, this 
inverter fills a specific niche in the 
ABB product line to cater for those 
installations producing between 5kW 
and 20kW.
This inverter includes dual input 
section to process two strings with 
independent Multiple Power Point 
Tracker (MPPT).
The high-speed and precise MPPT 
algorithm offers real-time power 
tracking and energy harvesting. 
Flat efficiency curves ensure high-
efficiency at all output levels ensuring 
consistent and stable performance 
across the entire input voltage and 
output power range. 
This outdoor inverter has been 
designed as a completely sealed unit to 
withstand the harshest environmental 
conditions. 
The wide input voltage range makes 
the inverter suitable for low-power 
installations with reduced string size.
The transformerless operation offers 
high performance efficiencies of up to 
97.1 percent. 
Free remote monitoring capability is 
available with every installation. This 
enables homeowners to view their 
energy production and offers installers 
a proactive and economic way of 
maintaining and troubleshooting the 
system.
