Report of List of Safety Observations Collected from Field Technicians 
Date of Report: July 1, 2025 
 
Field Safety Observations (July 1 – December 31 2024): 
1. During a morning vehicle inspection, I found one of the truck’s rear brake lights was 
out. This could have led to unsafe driving conditions, especially during long highway 
runs. The issue was reported and corrected before departure. 
2. While moving through a substation yard, I spotted a partially buried cable protruding 
above ground. It created a trip hazard near the walkway. I flagged it with caution 
tape and reported it to site operations. 
3. A coworker attempted to lift a junction box without assistance. The weight exceeded 
safe manual lifting limits. I stopped work and reminded the team to use a two-
person lift or mechanical aid. 
4. During PPE checks, a technician had a cracked face shield. This would not have 
provided proper arc-flash protection during switching. The shield was replaced 
before work started. 
5. While driving to site, I observed a tech on our crew using their phone to check 
directions. This presented a distracted driving hazard. I reminded them to use 
hands-free navigation before continuing. 
6. At a wind site, I found the turbine tower ladder fall-arrest system had a frayed 
section of cable. I locked out the climb and called in maintenance. No climbing was 
performed until it was corrected. 
7. While reviewing site access, a truck entered the access road too quickly, kicking up 
dust and reducing visibility. I reminded the driver about speed control and safe 
approach on unpaved roads. 
8. At the battery storage yard, a cooling fan cover was missing on one container unit. 
This exposed sharp edges and moving parts. Work was stopped until the area was 
made safe. 
9. A spilled cup of coffee in the control trailer created a slip hazard near the entrance. I 
cleaned the area and placed a sign until dry. Such small hazards can lead to injuries 
if not addressed.

10. While conducting a lockout/tagout, I noticed the tag did not include the technician’s 
full name and date. Incomplete information could cause confusion during shift 
handover. The tag was corrected immediately. 
11. On the way to a solar site, our truck’s low tire pressure indicator came on. We pulled 
over and confirmed one tire was at 50% pressure. It was unsafe to continue until the 
tire was repaired. 
12. While walking a PV array row, I tripped slightly over a grounding cable that was not 
secured tightly. This could easily cause a fall. I reported it and placed a cone until 
repair. 
13. During inverter troubleshooting, a technician reached into the cabinet without 
voltage testing the bus first. I stopped them and reminded them of the test-before-
touch rule. Work resumed safely afterward. 
14. At the EV charging site, I saw an extension cord being used across a walkway. It 
posed a trip hazard for pedestrians. I re-routed the cord overhead with a hook. 
15. While performing a harness check, I noticed one lanyard hook was cracked. Using 
this could have resulted in fall arrest failure. The equipment was tagged out and 
replaced. 
16. Driving through a rural access road, I saw deer crossing ahead. Quick braking 
prevented a collision, but it reinforced the need to watch wildlife in these areas. The 
crew was reminded at tailboard. 
17. At a BESS container, a technician attempted to bypass a panel interlock. I stopped 
the work and reinforced that interlocks must never be bypassed. The supervisor was 
informed. 
18. While unloading tools from the truck bed, one of the ratchet straps failed. Tools 
nearly fell onto the ground and could have struck feet. Straps were replaced with 
new ones. 
19. At the substation, I found a missing ground clamp on a portable grounding set. This 
could compromise electrical safety. The set was removed from service immediately. 
20. A colleague reported dizziness after climbing a turbine tower. We stopped work and 
escorted them down carefully. Hydration and rest were provided before returning to 
work. 
21. While reviewing a fire extinguisher at site, I found the gauge was in the red zone. This 
unit would not have functioned in an emergency. The extinguisher was replaced.

22. While walking across the solar field, uneven ground caused a near ankle twist. I 
marked the depression and reported it to site management for grading. 
23. In the control trailer, an overloaded power strip was being used for multiple 
chargers. This created a fire hazard. I redistributed loads and unplugged 
nonessential devices. 
24. During a storm, a technician attempted to continue working outdoors near the array. 
Lightning was approaching. I stopped all work until conditions were safe. 
25. While inspecting safety glasses, I found one pair without side shields. These would 
not protect adequately during grinding work. Correct PPE was issued before the 
task. 
26. At a wind farm parking area, I noticed a truck parked blocking the fire lane. This 
could impede emergency access. The vehicle was moved immediately. 
27. A site worker was carrying two heavy toolboxes without gloves. One slipped and 
nearly pinched their hand. Gloves and a two-person carry were required moving 
forward. 
28. While testing a disconnect switch, the handle was stiff and did not fully engage. This 
could leave equipment partially energized. I tagged it and reported it for 
maintenance. 
29. A vehicle inspection revealed windshield wipers that were worn out. Rain was 
forecast that afternoon, making this unsafe. Wipers were replaced before driving. 
30. During trench work for conduit, a worker stepped too close to the edge of the 
excavation without shoring. I stopped them and reminded about cave-in risk. 
Barricades were added. 
31. At the solar array, a panel junction box was open with exposed wiring. I stopped 
work in the row and reported it for immediate repair. Area was taped off. 
32. While transporting a ladder, a technician carried it horizontally without a spotter. It 
nearly struck another worker passing by. I corrected the method and provided a 
spotter. 
33. During tower climbing prep, a tech’s harness D-ring showed signs of rust. This 
weakened equipment could fail during a fall. Harness was replaced before climbing.

34. A truck parked on uneven ground rolled slightly because wheel chocks were not 
placed. The movement was caught in time. Wheel chocks are now mandated during 
all stops on slope. 
35. While using a grinder, a worker did not secure their sleeves. The fabric nearly caught 
in the tool. I stopped the work and reminded about tight-fitting clothing. 
36. At a charging site, I saw a chemical spill from a leaking battery pack. I stopped the 
job and called HAZMAT for proper cleanup. No one was injured. 
37. A technician was about to enter a confined space container without a gas test. I 
intervened and ensured proper testing was performed first. The area was safe after 
clearance. 
38. During pre-drive, I found the truck’s rearview mirror loose. This could have led to 
poor visibility. The issue was fixed before heading out. 
39. While climbing stairs to the substation control house, I noticed ice accumulation. It 
created a slip hazard. I applied ice melt and posted caution signage. 
40. A coworker removed gloves to handle energized testing probes. I immediately 
stopped them and reminded about electrical PPE requirements. Correct gloves 
were worn thereafter. 
41. While checking grounding mats, I noticed corrosion around one bond point. This 
could compromise protection. The mat was replaced before continuing work. 
42. During a site walk, I found debris and packaging left in the walkway. It created a trip 
hazard. I cleaned the area and reminded the crew to keep clear paths. 
43. At the inverter skid, a cooling fan blade guard was missing. This posed a risk of 
contact with rotating equipment. The unit was tagged until fixed. 
44. While fueling the truck, a technician left the nozzle unattended. This is unsafe and 
could result in a spill. I reminded them to remain at the pump. 
45. On a long drive between sites, a crew member began showing signs of fatigue. We 
pulled over and switched drivers. Breaks were reinforced for long-distance travel. 
46. A site visitor attempted to enter without PPE. I stopped them and issued a hard hat, 
safety glasses, and vest. Orientation was provided before allowing entry. 
47. While troubleshooting a communication rack, a loose overhead cable fell when 
moved. It narrowly missed striking the worker. I secured all cables properly.

48. At a turbine pad, hydraulic oil was found leaking from a tool. I stopped use and 
reported it to prevent slip hazards and environmental contamination. 
49. While conducting an overhead lift, a rigger signaled without eye contact to the 
operator. This created confusion and nearly caused a dropped load. We reinforced 
clear communication protocols. 
50. While inspecting the ladder rack in the inverter station, I noticed the ladder feet 
were not fully stable on the gravel surface. I secured the base with rubber mats 
before use. A potential fall hazard was avoided. 
51. While walking near a BESS container, I found a set of unsecured gas cylinders 
standing upright without chains. These could easily tip and cause serious injury. I 
secured them and notified the site lead. 
52. During a pre-job briefing, one technician admitted to not sleeping well after a long 
drive. We decided to reassign tasks to avoid fatigue-related mistakes. Rest 
requirements were reinforced for the team. 
53. At the solar site, I found a live ant mound directly in front of a combiner box. It could 
cause technicians to trip or be bitten while servicing. The area was treated before 
proceeding. 
54. A worker was using earbuds while driving the site truck. This limited awareness of 
sirens and alarms. The behavior was corrected immediately. 
55. While handling a torque wrench, a technician used the wrong setting and nearly 
over-tightened a bus connection. I intervened and reminded the crew about 
verifying torque values against the work order. 
56. At the base of a turbine, I noticed coolant fluid dripping from a hose connection. It 
was creating a slick surface near the ladder entry. I placed absorbent pads and 
reported the leak. 
57. During a tool check, one worker’s insulated screwdriver had a cracked handle. The 
damage exposed conductive metal. The tool was removed from service. 
58. While approaching the yard, a semi-truck blocked the only emergency exit gate. I 
contacted the driver and cleared the access immediately. This highlighted the 
importance of keeping exits unobstructed. 
59. A team member almost stepped backward off a loading dock while giving hand 
signals. I reminded everyone to stay situationally aware during rigging operations. 
Guard rails were also reinstalled.

60. At the control room, a heater was plugged into a frayed extension cord. This 
presented a major fire hazard. The cord was removed and replaced with a safe one. 
61. While inspecting harnesses, I found one missing a leg strap. This would have failed 
during a fall. It was tagged and replaced. 
62. A technician drove past a stop sign inside the yard without slowing. I reminded the 
team that site traffic rules are just as critical as public road safety. Reinforcement 
was given during the next safety talk. 
63. During cable pulling, a worker placed their hand near the reel without gloves. The 
spinning reel nearly caught their fingers. Gloves were issued and safe distance was 
reinforced. 
64. At the EV charging site, I found a junction box missing its cover plate. The exposed 
wiring was vulnerable to weather and contact. I stopped work in the area until it was 
repaired. 
65. While on a long drive, I saw a coworker nodding off. I immediately offered to switch 
drivers and reminded them to call out fatigue before it becomes critical. We stopped 
for coffee and rest. 
66. A site worker carried a ladder vertically through a narrow walkway. The ladder nearly 
struck overhead conduit. We stopped and reviewed safe ladder handling. 
67. During storm prep, I noticed unsecured tarps flapping near electrical gear. They 
could have blown into energized components. The tarps were tied down or removed. 
68. At a wind site, I found a missing guardrail on the mezzanine platform. This was an 
immediate fall hazard. I locked out the platform until corrected. 
69. While refueling a generator, a tech did not wear safety glasses. A splash hazard was 
present. PPE compliance was enforced before continuing. 
70. On a site drive, a crew truck carried an unsecured ladder on the roof rack. The straps 
were loose, and it could have flown off. We re-secured the load properly. 
71. During a solar tracker inspection, I found one array moving out of alignment due to a 
loose drive arm. This created pinch hazards. Work was stopped in that row until 
maintenance arrived. 
72. While working in the substation, a worker set a metal water bottle on top of a live 
panel. I immediately removed it and reminded them about conductive items.

73. During a fire drill, one worker did not know the muster point location. We reviewed 
evacuation routes with the entire crew. 
74. At the inverter yard, I found a ground rod that had come loose from the bonding 
strap. This compromised grounding integrity. It was repaired before energization. 
75. A crew member was seen chewing tobacco inside the turbine tower. This distracted 
them during ladder climbing. They were reminded of safe climbing practices and no-
tobacco rules. 
76. While checking a torque gun, I found the battery pack leaking fluid. The tool was 
taken out of service, and the spill was cleaned. 
77. At a PV site, cattle from a nearby ranch entered the perimeter through a broken 
fence. This created unexpected hazards around the work zone. The area was 
secured and reported. 
78. During confined space entry, a worker attempted to enter without a spotter present. 
I stopped the activity and reinforced buddy system protocols. 
79. While preparing to hoist tools, a worker placed them loosely in a bucket. Items 
nearly fell during lifting. We switched to a secured tool bag. 
80. On a night shift, I noticed insufficient lighting in the inverter yard. Workers could 
easily trip over cables. Temporary lighting towers were set up. 
81. At the EV site, I found a charging connector left hanging by its cord. This damaged 
the insulation and created a hazard. It was reported and taken out of service. 
82. While removing weeds from under panels, a technician used a lighter to burn dry 
grass. I stopped the unsafe act immediately and explained the fire hazard. 
83. A site visitor walked into the laydown yard without steel-toed boots. They were 
stopped and issued proper PPE. Entry is restricted until compliance is verified. 
84. During grounding verification, a tech nearly connected a clamp to painted metal 
instead of bare surface. I intervened to ensure proper bonding. 
85. While transporting a load on a forklift, the operator drove with the forks raised too 
high. This created instability. The operator was corrected and retrained. 
86. At the turbine base, a bucket of hydraulic oil was left without a lid. Dust and dirt 
could contaminate the fluid. The container was sealed and stored properly.

87. While driving at dawn, a worker did not turn on vehicle headlights. This made the 
truck less visible. We stopped and reviewed driving procedures. 
88. During equipment inspection, a fire alarm pull station was blocked by stored boxes. 
I cleared the area and reminded everyone about keeping egress routes open. 
89. At the battery yard, a bird’s nest was found inside a cooling vent. This blocked 
airflow and posed fire risks. The unit was powered down for cleaning. 
90. While carrying conduit, a worker swung it around and nearly struck another 
technician. I stopped the unsafe behavior and explained safe handling. 
91. During overhead crane use, a worker walked under a suspended load. I immediately 
stopped the operation and reinforced the no-walk zone. 
92. At the control room, a space heater was left on unattended overnight. This created a 
fire hazard. The heater was unplugged and banned for unattended use. 
93. While checking the eyewash station, I found the water flow was weak and 
inconsistent. The unit was tagged out until fixed. 
94. On the access road, a crew truck followed another vehicle too closely. This left no 
time to react in case of sudden stops. We reinforced safe following distances. 
95. While grinding metal, a worker did not use hearing protection. The noise levels 
exceeded safe limits. Earplugs were issued before continuing. 
96. At the wind site, I found a technician climbing without chin straps fastened on their 
helmet. This posed a risk of headgear falling. The issue was corrected before 
climbing continued. 
97. During breaker testing, one worker attempted to use a multimeter with a damaged 
probe. I stopped the work and provided safe test leads. 
98. While walking near the warehouse, I noticed a forklift operator driving with reduced 
visibility due to stacked boxes. I flagged them down and asked for a spotter. 
99. At the PV site, a snake was found under a combiner box. Work was stopped until the 
animal safely left. The area was flagged for awareness. 
100. 
While checking the substation transformer, I noticed oil staining at the base 
indicating a possible leak. This could worsen into a fire hazard. It was reported for 
immediate maintenance.

101. 
While unloading conduit, I noticed a worker carrying multiple lengths without 
watching their footing. They stumbled on uneven ground and nearly fell. I reminded 
the team to use spotters and carry manageable loads. 
102. 
At the solar tracker motor, I found loose bolts on the mounting bracket. The 
assembly could have dropped unexpectedly. Work was paused until the bracket 
was tightened. 
103. 
During a site walk, I observed a technician climbing a short step ladder 
without maintaining three points of contact. They almost lost balance while 
reaching overhead. Safe climbing procedures were reinforced. 
104. 
A crew member was about to enter the inverter yard without a hard hat, 
assuming it was a low-risk zone. I reminded them PPE is required at all times on site. 
They complied immediately. 
105. 
While driving into a remote site, our truck’s check engine light came on. We 
pulled over and contacted fleet for guidance. Continuing without assessment could 
have led to breakdown on isolated roads. 
106. 
At the wind site, a harness lanyard was stored improperly in the bottom of a 
tool bag, tangled with sharp tools. This could damage the webbing. I instructed the 
tech to store fall protection separately. 
107. 
During a panel cleaning operation, a worker carried a bucket of water across 
uneven ground without a lid. They nearly spilled it onto electrical cables. We 
switched to closed containers. 
108. 
In the yard, I found a pallet stacked too high with boxes, leaning dangerously. 
It posed a collapse hazard. The pallet was restacked properly. 
109. 
A worker attempted to lift a transformer cover by themselves, ignoring the 
team lift policy. The load was awkward and unsafe. I stopped the task until help was 
secured. 
110. 
At the EV site, a charging cable was stretched tightly across a driveway. A 
vehicle nearly ran over it. We rerouted the cable to eliminate the hazard. 
111. 
During fire extinguisher checks, I found one unit blocked by stored ladders. 
This would have delayed access in an emergency. The ladders were relocated 
immediately.

112. 
A technician attempted to test live conductors without insulated gloves, 
relying only on the tool insulation. I stopped the work and reminded them of the 
layered PPE requirement. 
113. 
While reversing the truck at site, the driver did not use a spotter even though 
pedestrians were present. I stopped the vehicle and ensured a spotter was 
assigned. 
114. 
At a turbine pad, I saw hydraulic hoses routed across a walkway without 
covers. This created a trip hazard. Protective ramps were installed. 
115. 
During inverter cabinet work, I noticed the door’s prop arm was broken. The 
door could have slammed shut unexpectedly. We tied it back until it could be 
repaired. 
116. 
A crew member climbed a tower without checking the weather. High winds 
made climbing unsafe. The climb was stopped immediately. 
117. 
While handling conduit threading oil, a container was found without a label. 
This created confusion about contents and hazards. The container was relabeled 
correctly. 
118. 
At the PV array, a wasp nest was found inside a combiner box. I stopped work 
until the area was treated. 
119. 
During tool inventory, I discovered a hammer with a cracked handle. It could 
have broken during use. The tool was removed from service. 
120. 
A truck left idling unattended near fuel storage tanks. This posed a fire 
hazard. The engine was shut down immediately. 
121. 
At the inverter pad, I found an electrical junction box cover missing screws. 
The loose cover could expose wiring. Screws were replaced before continuing. 
122. 
While doing overhead lifting, the load was swung over a work area. I stopped 
the lift until the exclusion zone was cleared. 
123. 
A worker used a step stool on top of a platform to gain extra height. This was 
highly unstable. I intervened and provided the correct ladder. 
124. 
During lockout-tagout, I found a tag written in pencil that was already fading. 
Permanent markers are required. It was corrected before proceeding. 
125. 
A technician entered the site without sunscreen or long sleeves on a high UV 
index day. Heat and sun hazards were reviewed, and PPE adjusted.
