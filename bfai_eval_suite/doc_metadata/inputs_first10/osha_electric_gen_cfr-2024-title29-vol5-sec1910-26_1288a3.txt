(viii) Environmental conditions re-
lating to safety. 
(b) Medical services and first aid. The 
employer shall provide medical serv-
ices and first aid as required in 
§ 1910.151. In addition to the require-
ments of § 1910.151, the following re-
quirements also apply: 
(1) First-aid training. When employees 
are performing work on, or associated 
with, exposed lines or equipment ener-
gized at 50 volts or more, persons with 
first-aid training shall be available as 
follows: 
(i) For field work involving two or 
more employees at a work location, at 
least two trained persons shall be 
available. However, for line-clearance 
tree trimming performed by line-clear-
ance tree trimmers who are not quali-
fied employees, only one trained person 
need be available if all new employees 
are trained in first aid within 3 months 
of their hiring dates. 
(ii) For fixed work locations such as 
substations, the number of trained per-
sons available shall be sufficient to en-
sure that each employee exposed to 
electric shock can be reached within 4 
minutes by a trained person. However, 
where the existing number of employ-
ees is insufficient to meet this require-
ment (at a remote substation, for ex-
ample), each employee at the work lo-
cation shall be a trained employee. 
(2) First-aid supplies. First-aid sup-
plies required by § 1910.151(b) shall be 
placed in weatherproof containers if 
the supplies could be exposed to the 
weather. 
(3) First-aid kits. The employer shall 
maintain each first-aid kit, shall en-
sure that it is readily available for use, 
and shall inspect it frequently enough 
to ensure that expended items are re-
placed. The employer also shall inspect 
each first aid kit at least once per 
year. 
(c) Job briefing—(1) Before each job. (i) 
In assigning an employee or a group of 
employees to perform a job, the em-
ployer shall provide the employee in 
charge of the job with all available in-
formation that relates to the deter-
mination of existing characteristics 
and conditions required by paragraph 
(a)(4) of this section. 
(ii) The employer shall ensure that 
the employee in charge conducts a job 
briefing that meets paragraphs (c)(2), 
(c)(3), and (c)(4) of this section with the 
employees involved before they start 
each job. 
(2) Subjects to be covered. The briefing 
shall cover at least the following sub-
jects: hazards associated with the job, 
work procedures involved, special pre-
cautions, energy-source controls, and 
personal protective equipment require-
ments. 
(3) Number of briefings. (i) If the work 
or operations to be performed during 
the work day or shift are repetitive and 
similar, at least one job briefing shall 
be conducted before the start of the 
first job of each day or shift. 
(ii) Additional job briefings shall be 
held 
if 
significant 
changes, 
which 
might affect the safety of the employ-
ees, occur during the course of the 
work. 
(4) Extent of briefing. (i) A brief dis-
cussion is satisfactory if the work in-
volved is routine and if the employees, 
by virtue of training and experience, 
can reasonably be expected to recog-
nize and avoid the hazards involved in 
the job. 
(ii) A more extensive discussion shall 
be conducted: 
(A) If the work is complicated or par-
ticularly hazardous, or 
(B) If the employee cannot be ex-
pected to recognize and avoid the haz-
ards involved in the job. 
NOTE
TO
PARAGRAPH (c)(4): The briefing 
must address all the subjects listed in para-
graph (c)(2) of this section. 
(5) Working alone. An employee work-
ing alone need not conduct a job brief-
ing. However, the employer shall en-
sure that the tasks to be performed are 
planned as if a briefing were required. 
(d) Hazardous energy control (lockout/ 
tagout) procedures—(1) Application. The 
provisions of paragraph (d) of this sec-
tion apply to the use of lockout/tagout 
procedures for the control of energy 
sources in installations for the purpose 
of electric power generation, including 
related equipment for communication 
or metering. Locking and tagging pro-
cedures for the deenergizing of electric 
energy sources which are used exclu-
sively for purposes of transmission and 
distribution are addressed by para-
graph (m) of this section.

§ 1910.269 
NOTE TO PARAGRAPH (d)(1): Installations in 
electric power generation facilities that are 
not an integral part of, or inextricably com-
mingled with, power generation processes or 
equipment are covered under § 1910.147 and 
Subpart S of this part. 
(2) General. (i) The employer shall es-
tablish a program consisting of energy 
control procedures, employee training, 
and periodic inspections to ensure that, 
before any employee performs any 
servicing or maintenance on a machine 
or equipment where the unexpected en-
ergizing, start up, or release of stored 
energy could occur and cause injury, 
the machine or equipment is isolated 
from the energy source and rendered 
inoperative. 
(ii) The employer’s energy control 
program under paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section shall meet the following re-
quirements: 
(A) If an energy isolating device is 
not capable of being locked out, the 
employer’s program shall use a tagout 
system. 
(B) If an energy isolating device is 
capable of being locked out, the em-
ployer’s program shall use lockout, un-
less the employer can demonstrate 
that the use of a tagout system will 
provide full employee protection as fol-
lows: 
(1) When a tagout device is used on 
an energy isolating device which is ca-
pable of being locked out, the tagout 
device shall be attached at the same lo-
cation that the lockout device would 
have been attached, and the employer 
shall demonstrate that the tagout pro-
gram will provide a level of safety 
equivalent to that obtained by the use 
of a lockout program. 
(2) In demonstrating that a level of 
safety is achieved in the tagout pro-
gram equivalent to the level of safety 
obtained by the use of a lockout pro-
gram, the employer shall demonstrate 
full compliance with all tagout-related 
provisions of this standard together 
with such additional elements as are 
necessary to provide the equivalent 
safety available from the use of a lock-
out device. Additional means to be con-
sidered as part of the demonstration of 
full employee protection shall include 
the implementation of additional safe-
ty measures such as the removal of an 
isolating circuit element, blocking of a 
controlling switch, opening of an extra 
disconnecting device, or the removal of 
a valve handle to reduce the likelihood 
of inadvertent energizing.

§ 1910.269 
(D) Where tagout is used for energy 
control, the periodic inspection shall 
include a review, between the inspector 
and each authorized and affected em-
ployee, of that employee’s responsibil-
ities under the energy control proce-
dure being inspected, and the elements 
set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(vii) of this 
section. 
(E) The employer shall certify that 
the inspections required by paragraph 
(d)(2)(v) of this section have been ac-
complished. 
The 
certification 
shall 
identify the machine or equipment on 
which the energy control procedure 
was being used, the date of the inspec-
tion, the employees included in the in-
spection, and the person performing 
the inspection. 
NOTE TO PARAGRAPH (d)(2)(v)(E): If normal 
work schedule and operation records dem-
onstrate adequate inspection activity and 
contain the required information, no addi-
tional certification is required. 
(vi) The employer shall provide train-
ing to ensure that the purpose and 
function of the energy control program 
are understood by employees and that 
the knowledge and skills required for 
the safe application, usage, and re-
moval of energy controls are acquired 
by employees. The training shall in-
clude the following: 
(A) Each authorized employee shall 
receive training in the recognition of 
applicable hazardous energy sources, 
the type and magnitude of energy 
available in the workplace, and in the 
methods and means necessary for en-
ergy isolation and control. 
(B) Each affected employee shall be 
instructed in the purpose and use of 
the energy control procedure. 
(C) All other employees whose work 
operations are or may be in an area 
where energy control procedures may 
be used shall be instructed about the 
procedures and about the prohibition 
relating to attempts to restart or re-
energize machines or equipment that 
are locked out or tagged out. 
(vii) When tagout systems are used, 
employees shall also be trained in the 
following limitations of tags: 
(A) Tags are essentially warning de-
vices affixed to energy isolating de-
vices and do not provide the physical 
restraint on those devices that is pro-
vided by a lock. 
(B) When a tag is attached to an en-
ergy isolating means, it is not to be re-
moved without authorization of the au-
thorized person responsible for it, and 
it is never to be bypassed, ignored, or 
otherwise defeated. 
(C) Tags must be legible and under-
standable by all authorized employees, 
affected employees, and all other em-
ployees whose work operations are or 
may be in the area, in order to be effec-
tive. 
(D) Tags and their means of attach-
ment must be made of materials which 
will withstand the environmental con-
ditions encountered in the workplace. 
(E) Tags may evoke a false sense of 
security, and their meaning needs to be 
understood as part of the overall en-
ergy control program. 
(F) Tags must be securely attached 
to energy isolating devices so that they 
cannot be inadvertently or acciden-
tally detached during use. 
(viii) Retraining shall be provided by 
the employer as follows: 
(A) Retraining shall be provided for 
all authorized and affected employees 
whenever there is a change in their job 
assignments, a change in machines, 
equipment, or processes that present a 
new hazard or whenever there is a 
change in the energy control proce-
dures. 
(B) Retraining shall also be con-
ducted whenever a periodic inspection 
under paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section 
reveals, or whenever the employer has 
reason to believe, that there are devi-
ations from or inadequacies in an em-
ployee’s knowledge or use of the energy 
control procedures. 
(C) The retraining shall reestablish 
employee proficiency and shall intro-
duce new or revised control methods 
and procedures, as necessary. 
(ix) The employer shall certify that 
employee training has been accom-
plished and is being kept up to date. 
The certification shall contain each 
employee’s name and dates of training. 
(3) Protective materials and hardware. 
(i) Locks, tags, chains, wedges, key 
blocks, adapter pins, self-locking fas-
teners, or other hardware shall be pro-
vided by the employer for isolating, se-
curing, or blocking of machines or 
equipment from energy sources.

§ 1910.269 
(ii) Lockout devices and tagout de-
vices shall be singularly identified; 
shall be the only devices used for con-
trolling energy; may not be used for 
other purposes; and shall meet the fol-
lowing requirements: 
(A) Lockout devices and tagout de-
vices shall be capable of withstanding 
the environment to which they are ex-
posed for the maximum period of time 
that exposure is expected. 
(1) Tagout devices shall be con-
structed and printed so that exposure 
to weather conditions or wet and damp 
locations will not cause the tag to de-
teriorate or the message on the tag to 
become illegible. 
(2) Tagout devices shall be so con-
structed as not to deteriorate when 
used in corrosive environments. 
(B) Lockout devices and tagout de-
vices shall be standardized within the 
facility in at least one of the following 
criteria: color, shape, size. Addition-
ally, in the case of tagout devices, 
print and format shall be standardized. 
(C) Lockout devices shall be substan-
tial enough to prevent removal without 
the use of excessive force or unusual 
techniques, such as with the use of bolt 
cutters or metal cutting tools. 
(D) Tagout devices, including their 
means of attachment, shall be substan-
tial enough to prevent inadvertent or 
accidental removal. Tagout device at-
tachment means shall be of a non-reus-
able type, attachable by hand, self- 
locking, and nonreleasable with a min-
imum unlocking strength of no less 
than 50 pounds and shall have the gen-
eral design and basic characteristics of 
being at least equivalent to a one- 
piece, all-environment-tolerant nylon 
cable tie. 
(E) Each lockout device or tagout de-
vice shall include provisions for the 
identification of the employee applying 
the device. 
(F) Tagout devices shall warn against 
hazardous conditions if the machine or 
equipment is energized and shall in-
clude a legend such as the following: 
Do Not Start, Do Not Open, Do Not

ate. 
NOTE TO PARAGRAPH (d)(3)(ii)(F): For spe-
cific provisions covering accident prevention 
tags, see § 1910.145. 
(4) Energy isolation. Lockout and 
tagout device application and removal 
may only be performed by the author-
ized employees who are performing the 
servicing or maintenance. 
(5) Notification. Affected employees 
shall be notified by the employer or au-
thorized employee of the application 
and removal of lockout or tagout de-
vices. Notification shall be given before 
the controls are applied and after they 
are removed from the machine or 
equipment. 
NOTE TO PARAGRAPH (d)(5): See also para-
graph (d)(7) of this section, which requires 
that the second notification take place be-
fore the machine or equipment is reener-
gized. 
(6) Lockout/tagout application. The es-
tablished procedures for the applica-
tion of energy control (the lockout or 
tagout procedures) shall include the 
following elements and actions, and 
these procedures shall be performed in 
the following sequence: 
(i) Before an authorized or affected 
employee turns off a machine or equip-
ment, the authorized employee shall 
have knowledge of the type and mag-
nitude of the energy, the hazards of the 
energy to be controlled, and the meth-
od or means to control the energy. 
(ii) The machine or equipment shall 
be turned off or shut down using the 
procedures established for the machine 
or equipment. An orderly shutdown 
shall be used to avoid any additional or 
increased hazards to employees as a re-
sult of the equipment stoppage. 
(iii) All energy isolating devices that 
are needed to control the energy to the 
machine or equipment shall be phys-
ically located and operated in such a 
manner as to isolate the machine or 
equipment from energy sources. 
(iv) Lockout or tagout devices shall 
be affixed to each energy isolating de-
vice by authorized employees. 
(A) Lockout devices shall be attached 
in a manner that will hold the energy 
isolating devices in a ‘‘safe’’ or ‘‘off’’ 
position. 
(B) Tagout devices shall be affixed in 
such a manner as will clearly indicate 
that the operation or movement of en-
ergy isolating devices from the ‘‘safe’’ 
or ‘‘off’’ position is prohibited.

with the capability of being locked out, 
the tag attachment shall be fastened at 
the same point at which the lock would 
have been attached. 
(2) Where a tag cannot be affixed di-
rectly to the energy isolating device, 
the tag shall be located as close as 
safely possible to the device, in a posi-
tion that will be immediately obvious 
to anyone attempting to operate the 
device. 
(v) Following the application of lock-
out or tagout devices to energy iso-
lating devices, all potentially haz-
ardous stored or residual energy shall 
be relieved, disconnected, restrained, 
or otherwise rendered safe. 
(vi) If there is a possibility of re-
accumulation of stored energy to a 
hazardous level, verification of isola-
tion shall be continued until the serv-
icing or maintenance is completed or 
until the possibility of such accumula-
tion no longer exists. 
(vii) Before starting work on ma-
chines or equipment that have been 
locked out or tagged out, the author-
ized employee shall verify that isola-
tion and deenergizing of the machine 
or equipment have been accomplished. 
If normally energized parts will be ex-
posed to contact by an employee while 
the machine or equipment is deener-
gized, a test shall be performed to en-
sure that these parts are deenergized. 
(7) Release from lockout/tagout. Before 
lockout or tagout devices are removed 
and energy is restored to the machine 
or equipment, procedures shall be fol-
lowed and actions taken by the author-
ized employees to ensure the following: 
(i) The work area shall be inspected 
to ensure that nonessential items have 
been removed and that machine or 
equipment components are operation-
ally intact. 
(ii) The work area shall be checked to 
ensure that all employees have been 
safely positioned or removed. 
(iii) After lockout or tagout devices 
have been removed and before a ma-
chine or equipment is started, affected 
employees shall be notified that the 
lockout or tagout devices have been re-
moved. 
(iv) Each lockout or tagout device 
shall be removed from each energy iso-
lating device by the authorized em-
ployee who applied the lockout or 
tagout device. However, if that em-
ployee is not available to remove it, 
the device may be removed under the 
direction of the employer, provided 
that specific procedures and training 
for such removal have been developed, 
documented, and incorporated into the 
employer’s energy control program. 
The employer shall demonstrate that 
the specific procedure provides a de-
gree of safety equivalent to that pro-
vided by the removal of the device by 
the authorized employee who applied 
it. The specific procedure shall include 
at least the following elements: 
(A) Verification by the employer that 
the authorized employee who applied 
the device is not at the facility; 
(B) Making all reasonable efforts to 
contact the authorized employee to in-
form him or her that his or her lockout 
or tagout device has been removed; and 
(C) Ensuring that the authorized em-
ployee has this knowledge before he or 
she resumes work at that facility. 
(8) Additional requirements. (i) If the 
lockout or tagout devices must be tem-
porarily removed from energy isolating 
devices and the machine or equipment 
must be energized to test or position 
the machine, equipment, or component 
thereof, the following sequence of ac-
tions shall be followed: 
(A) Clear the machine or equipment 
of tools and materials in accordance 
with paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this section; 
(B) Remove employees from the ma-
chine or equipment area in accordance 
with paragraphs (d)(7)(ii) and (d)(7)(iii) 
of this section; 
(C) Remove the lockout or tagout de-
vices as specified in paragraph (d)(7)(iv)

but not limited to, the following spe-
cific requirements: 
(A) Primary responsibility shall be 
vested in an authorized employee for a 
set 
number 
of 
employees 
working 
under the protection of a group lockout 
or tagout device (such as an operations 
lock); 
(B) Provision shall be made for the 
authorized employee to ascertain the 
exposure status of all individual group 
members with regard to the lockout or 
tagout of the machine or equipment; 
(C) When more than one crew, craft, 
department, or other group is involved, 
assignment of overall job-associated 
lockout or tagout control responsi-
bility shall be given to an authorized 
employee designated to coordinate af-
fected work forces and ensure con-
tinuity of protection; and 
(D) Each authorized employee shall 
affix a personal lockout or tagout de-
vice to the group lockout device, group 
lockbox, or comparable mechanism 
when he or she begins work and shall 
remove those devices when he or she 
stops working on the machine or equip-
ment being serviced or maintained. 
(iii) Procedures shall be used during 
shift or personnel changes to ensure 
the continuity of lockout or tagout 
protection, including provision for the 
orderly transfer of lockout or tagout 
device protection between off-going 
and on-coming employees, to minimize 
their exposure to hazards from the un-
expected energizing or start-up of the 
machine or equipment or from the re-
lease of stored energy. 
(iv) Whenever outside servicing per-
sonnel are to be engaged in activities 
covered by paragraph (d) of this sec-
tion, the on-site employer and the out-
side employer shall inform each other 
of their respective lockout or tagout 
procedures, and each employer shall 
ensure that his or her personnel under-
stand and comply with restrictions and 
prohibitions of the energy control pro-
cedures being used.
