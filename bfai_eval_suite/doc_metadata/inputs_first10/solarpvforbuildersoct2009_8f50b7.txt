Introduction 
As the demand for solar electric systems grows, progressive builders are adding solar 
photovoltaics (PV) as an option for their customers.  This overview of solar photovoltaic 
systems will give the builder a basic understanding of: 
  
• Evaluating a building site for its solar potential  
• Common grid-connected PV system configurations and components  
• Considerations in selecting components  
• Considerations in design and installation of a PV system  
• Typical costs and the labor required to install a PV system  
• Building and electric code requirements  
• Where to find more information  
 
Emphasis will be placed on information that will be useful in including a grid-connected 
PV system in a bid for a residential or small commercial building.  We will also cover 
those details of the technology and installation that may be helpful in selecting 
subcontractors to perform the work, working with a designer, and directing work as it 
proceeds.  A summary of system types and components is given so the builder will know 
what to expect to see in a design submitted by a subcontractor or PV designer. 
 
In 2008, the installed cost of a residential PV system in the United States typically ranged 
from $8 to $10 per installed watt before government or utility incentives.  For more detail 
on costs, see the section titled “Cost Considerations.”  For information on putting 
together your installation team, refer to the section “The Project Team.”

Evaluating a Site for Solar PV Potential 
Does the Pacific Northwest Have Good Solar Potential? – This is a very common 
question and the answer is, yes, the Pacific Northwest gets enough sun for grid-connected 
photovoltaic systems to operate well.  The Northwest’s highest solar potential is east of 
the Cascades.  But even west of the Cascades, the Oregon’s Willamette Valley receives 
as much solar energy annually as the U.S. average – as much over the course of the year 
as southern France and more than Germany, the current leader in solar electric 
installations.  Under cloudy conditions, it is true that photovoltaics produce only 5 to 30 
percent of their maximum output.  However, because solar photovoltaics become less 
efficient when hot, our cooler climate and our long summer days help make up for the 
cloudy days. 
 
Evaluating a Building Site – While the Pacific Northwest may have good to excellent 
solar potential, not every building site will be suitable for a solar installation. The first 
step in the design of a photovoltaic system is determining if the site you are considering 
has good solar potential.  Some questions you should ask are: 
 
• Is the installation site free from shading by nearby trees, buildings or other 
obstructions? 
• Can the PV system be oriented for good performance? 
• Does the roof or property have enough area to accommodate the solar array? 
• If the array will be roof-mounted, what kind of roof is it and what is its condition? 
 
Mounting Location – Solar modules are usually mounted on roofs.  If roof area is not 
available, PV modules can be pole-mounted, ground-mounted, wall-mounted or installed 
as part of a shade structure (refer to the section “System Components/Array Mounting 
Racks” below).   
 
Shading – Photovoltaic arrays are adversely affected by shading.  A well-designed PV 
system needs clear and unobstructed access to the sun’s rays from about 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., 
throughout the year.  Even small shadows, such as the shadow of a single branch of a 
leafless tree can significantly reduce the power output of a solar module.1  Shading from 
the building itself – due to vents, attic fans, skylights, gables or overhangs – must also be 
avoided.  Keep in mind that an area may be unshaded during one part of the day, but 
shaded at another part of the day.  Also, a site that is unshaded in the summer may be 
shaded in the winter due to longer winter shadows.2    
 
Orientation – In northern latitudes, by conventional wisdom PV modules are ideally 
oriented towards true south.3  But the tilt or orientation of a roof does not need to be 
                                                 
1 This is because when manufacturers assemble solar modules from cells, they wire groups of cells in series 
with each other.  Shading one cell will essentially turn off all the cells in its group.    
2 Shading can be evaluated using tools such as the “Solar Path Finder” (www.solarpathfinder.com).   
3 Deviations between magnetic and true south, referred to as magnetic declination, vary by location.  
Magnetic declination changes slowly over time, so be sure to use data within the last decade or so.  Obtain

perfect because solar modules produce 95 percent of their full power when within 20 
degrees of the sun’s direction.  Roofs that face east or west may also be acceptable.  As 
an example, a due west facing rooftop solar PV system, tilted at 20 degrees in Salem, 
Oregon, will produce about 88 percent as much power as one pointing true south at the 
same location.  Flat roofs work well because the PV modules can be mounted on frames 
and tilted up toward true south. 
 
Optimum orientation can be influenced by typical local weather patterns.  For example, 
western Washington and Oregon frequently have a marine layer of fog that burns off by 
late morning and so have better solar resource after noon than before noon.  Thus, west of 
the Cascades, the maximum power is generated with a southwest orientation.  
 
Tilt – Generally the optimum tilt of a PV array in the Pacific Northwest equals the 
geographic latitude minus about 15 degrees to achieve yearly maximum output of power.  
An increased tilt favors power output in the winter and a decreased tilt favors output in 
the summer.  In western Washington and Oregon, with their cloudier winters, the 
optimum angle is less than the optimum east of the Cascades.  
 
Nevertheless, it is recommended that modules be installed at the same pitch as a sloping 
roof, whatever that slope is, primarily for aesthetic reasons, but also because the tilt is 
very forgiving.  In Salem, Oregon, for example, tilts from 20 degrees to 45 degrees will 
result in approximately the same power production over the course of the year.  This is 
because tilts that are less than the latitude of the site increase summer production when 
the solar resource is most available here, but reduce winter production when it tends to be 
cloudy anyway.  
 
Required Area – Residential and small commercial systems require as little as 50 square 
feet for a small system up to as much as 1,000 square feet.  As a general rule for the 
Pacific Northwest, every 1,000 watts of PV modules requires 100 square feet of collector 
area for modules using crystalline silicon (currently the most common PV cell type).  
Each 1,000 watts of PV modules can generate about 1,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year 
in locations west of the Cascades and about 1,250 kWh per year east of the Cascades.  
When using less efficient modules, such as amorphous silicon or other thin-film types, 
the area will need to be approximately doubled.  If your location limits the physical size 
of your system, you may want to install a system that uses more-efficient PV modules.  
Keep in mind that access space around the modules can add up to 20 percent to the 
required area.   
 
Roof Types – For roof-mounted systems, typically composition shingles are easiest to 
work with and slate and tile roofs are the most difficult.  Nevertheless, it is possible to 
install PV modules on all roof types.  If the roof will need replacing within 5 to 10 years, 
it should be replaced at the time the PV system is installed to avoid the cost of removing 
and reinstalling the PV system.

magnetic declinations range from about 17 to 22 degrees east.

Building integrated PV (BIPV) modules, which can be integrated into the roof itself, 
might be considered for new construction or for an older roof in need of replacing.  While 
BIPV products currently have a premium price, costs are expected to decrease.
