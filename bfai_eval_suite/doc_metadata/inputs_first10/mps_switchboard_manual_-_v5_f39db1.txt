Introduction 
Section 1.0 – Introduction 
This instruction manual can be used by competent technicians to 
develop safe and efficient procedures and guidelines for installing, 
maintaining, and operating switchboard equipment. For additional 
information, refer to NEMA Standards Publication PB2.1, "General 
Instructions for Proper Handling, Installation, Operation, and 
Maintenance of Dead Front Distribution Switchboards rated 600 volts 
or less", which is available on the NEMA web site (www.nema.org).  
MPS warrants that all the goods manufactured by MPS strictly 
conform to accepted industrial standards regarding materials and 
workmanship, which are verified until the day of product shipment 
from the MPS factory. However, if any non-conformity is observed in 
the manufactured goods by the purchaser within the first twelve 
months from the date of shipment and promptly notifies MPS in 
writing, MPS will rectify the identified defect through adjustment, 
repair, or replacement of the item and any affected part of the goods. 
Purchasers may refer to "Standard Terms and Conditions of Sale" for 
the complete warranty terms and contact the MPS representative if 
additional information is required. 
1.1 Qualified Person 
The instructions in this manual are not meant to be used as substitutes 
for proper training and experience in safely operating the described 
equipment. Only "competent technicians" should be allowed to install, 
operate, and service the equipment. A competent technician should 
have the following qualifications:  
• They are thoroughly familiar with the instructions given here.  
• They are properly trained in industry-accepted low-voltage and 
high-voltage safe operating procedures and practices.  
• They are adequately trained and fully authorized to energize, de-
energize, ground, and clear power distribution equipment.  
• They are properly trained in the care and use of protective 
equipment such as rubber gloves, face shields, safety glasses, hard 
hats, clamp-sticks, arc flash clothing, hot-stick, etc.  
1.2 Signal Words 
Switchboard installation, operation, and maintenance procedures can 
give rise to various hazardous situations. Signal words like "Danger" 
"Warning" and "Caution" are used to indicate the degree of danger 
associated with these different hazards that the user may encounter. 
These signal words are defined as follows: 
• 
 indicates an imminently hazardous situation that 
will result in serious injury or even death. 
• 
 indicates a potentially hazardous situation that could 
result in serious injury or even death. 
• 
 indicates a potentially hazardous situation that may 
result in minor or moderate injury but not death. 
1.3 Dangerous Procedures 
In addition to the specific precautions that must be followed to ensure 
safety against various hazards and dangers associated with switchboard 
installation, operation, and maintenance procedures, user personnel 
must also always adhere to the following warnings: 
 
  
Hazardous voltage. Contact with hazardous voltage can cause severe 
injuries and even death. Personnel working around low-voltage and 
high-voltage lines and equipment should follow all locally approved 
safety procedures and practices, and only Qualified personnel should be 
allowed to work on or near high-voltage equipment.  
  
Ensure the switchboard equipment is completely de-energized and 
disconnected from the rest of the system to prevent accidental re-
energization. Otherwise, possible shocks from an energized 
switchboard component could lead to equipment damage, severe 
physical injuries, and even death. 
  
Always allow the interlock device or safety mechanism to function 
completely without forcing the device. 
  
Hydrocarbon compounds and spray propellants can cause the 
degradation of certain types of plastics used within the switchboard 
equipment. Contact MPS representatives before applying these 
products for cleaning and lubricating switchboard components.

1.5 General Description 
MPS switchboards are designed and manufactured to perform 
efficiently within standard operating conditions. The instructions 
provided in this manual aim to assist purchasers in deriving prolonged 
and economical switchboard functionality. This manual and its 
guidelines should be shared with operators and engineers associated 
with the owner/purchaser to ensure that the switchboards are operated 
and maintained in the best possible conditions.  
This manual covers the standard construction details of MPS 
switchboard assemblies, as defined in NFPA70 (NEC), UL891, and 
NEMA PB2, including the necessary accessories and auxiliary 
equipment. Any special or additional equipment furnished with the 
standard product, in accordance with the purchaser's order 
requirements, is covered separately in supplementary instruction 
books. All switchboard parts, conductors, and insulation materials are 
designed and constructed to meet the voltage class requirements of 
the system. Additionally, all switchboard components are enclosed 
within a grounded metal enclosure for added protection. 
MPS designs the switchboard equipment to cater to the specifications 
provided by the purchaser at the time of purchase. The final product, 
therefore, has the circuit capacity to meet the operating conditions of 
the purchaser's specified power system. However, the momentary 
rating of the switchboard and the interrupting capacity of the 
switchboard protective devices must be rechecked when installing the 
switchboard equipment in a different system or when the short-circuit 
capacity of the target system is increased. If the service is changed, the 
equipment's short circuit capacity, amperage, and voltage class should 


--- Page 7 ---
be checked to ensure they meet or exceed the new system's 
requirements.  
Switchboards are free-standing units rated at 1000 volts AC or less 
and 4000 amperes or less. A typical switchboard contains distribution 
sections with branch devices and service entrance sections with main 
devices. These sections contain auxiliary equipment, protective devices, 
disconnect devices, and current transformers for control, metering, or 
ground fault protection. 
Safety Precautions and Switchboard Preparation 
Switchboards are constructed in various sizes and mounting 
arrangements, depending on the purchaser's unique requirements. 
Outdoor switchboards are typically made by enclosing the equipment 
inside a weatherproof housing and fixing a door over the inner front 
panels. 
Section 2.0 - Safety Precautions 
  
Care should be taken when energizing a switchboard for the first time 
after initial installation or maintenance due to the potential danger 
posed by any undetected exposed parts. Contact with hazardous 
voltage through these parts can cause severe injuries and even death. 
The following safety precautions must be strictly followed while 
working on switchboard preparation: 
• Only qualified persons familiar with the operation and construction 
of the switchboard equipment should be allowed to perform the 
procedures described in this set of instructions.  
• Qualified persons should be allowed to work on the switchboard 
equipment only after reading this complete set of instructions. 
• The qualified persons should ensure they strictly follow the safety-
related work practices, as described in NFPA 70E. 
• Switchboard inspection and maintenance should only be performed 
after cutting off, disconnecting, and electrically isolating the 
switchboard so it cannot be accidentally re-energized.  
• Some electrical equipment can introduce harmonics in the electrical 
system and cause it to overheat. This condition should be 
considered when determining the switchboard loading. The 
equipment rating may need to be derated in case of excessive 
heating. 
Section 3.0 - Switchboard Preparation 
3.1 Receiving 
MPS inspects each switchboard before being shipped to the 
purchaser-designated site to ensure that the electrical and structural 
construction of the switchboard equipment complies with the 
applicable specifications, codes, and standards. Depending on the 
number of sections and the size of each section, the switchboard may 
be divided into one or more vertical pieces and placed onto wooden 
skids for easy shipping. Each piece is packaged, securely blocked, and 
braced for shipment.  
 
Regardless of the shipping method, every precaution is taken to 
minimize the possibility of damage to the equipment and to ensure 
its safe arrival. The packages are carefully loaded to prevent damage 
to the relatively delicate instruments or devices, and similar care 
must be exercised upon arrival at the required site. Once the 
switchboard equipment arrives at the required destination, the 
marking tag(s) or packing list(s) should be checked very carefully by 
the purchasing party against the equipment received to ensure the 
correct and complete list of equipment has been shipped. In case of 
any shortages or deficiencies, the purchasing party must claim in 
writing within the first 30 days of receipt of shipment. Failure to give 
such a notice would constitute an unqualified acceptance of the 
shipped goods and a waiver of any future claims.  
 
Marking tags are attached to every shipped package or crate for 
identification on shipments with more than one shipping group. In 
lieu of the marking tags, the section marking can be found on the 
rating label on each section, and the location of each unit within the 
group lineup can be found on the general arrangement drawing. 
 
3.2 Inspection 
The equipment should be inspected as soon as possible after the 
arrival of the shipment for any damage that may have occurred in 
transit. The packing of the switchboard components should be 
carefully removed to allow for inspections for possible damage. 
However, the packing material must not be discarded in the process, 
as the material itself can be used to store the equipment at the 
designated site until installation or to repackage the equipment for a 
return shipment if necessary. When moving or handling the 
switchboard, it should be kept upright and secured to the shipping skid 
to prevent distortion or damage to the bottom frame. 
3.3 Shipping Damage Claims 
If the goods get lost or damaged in transit, the purchaser must 
handle all claims directly with the carrier. The carrier must be 
notified about any concealed damage within 15 days after receipt of 
goods. The following procedures must be followed to ensure that the 
goods are received in accordance with the purchase order: 
• Upon arrival of the shipment, the purchasing party should note:  
 The blocking condition of the equipment.  
 The condition of the equipment upon arrival and whether it 
was properly protected from environmental factors like 
humidity, heat, wind, etc.  
 The trailer number on which the equipment arrived.  
 Whether the equipment count during unloading agrees with 
the delivery receipt. 
• An inspection should be made to detect any visible damage to the 
equipment as soon as possible upon arrival of the goods. If 
possible, such inspection should be finished on the shipping 
vehicle before the unloading process. However, if it is impossible, 
a close inspection of the goods should be maintained during the 
unloading process, and any signs of visible damage should be 
noted. Pictures may also be taken for evidence if possible. 
• Any visible damage on the equipment must be noted on the 
delivery receipt and signed by the driver to acknowledge the 
detected deformity. A detailed description of the damage should 
be added whenever possible, and the notation "Possible internal 
damage, subject to inspection" should be included on the delivery 
receipt. If the driver does not provide acknowledgment through a 
sign on the delivery receipt, the shipment should not be signed for 
or received by the consignee or their approved agent.  
• Any detected damage should be reported to the MPS Sales Office 
immediately. 
• If any damage is observed on the shipped equipment, the 
consignee or their agent must arrange a carrier inspection 
immediately. The equipment must not be removed from the place 
it was set by the carrier when unloading. This location should be 
properly protected to ensure further damage does not occur before 
an inspection from the carrier. This eliminates loss to the 
consignee arising from carrier claims that the equipment was 
damaged or the damage aggravated on-site after unloading. 
• The equipment should be covered properly to protect it from any 
further damage after unloading. The equipment should be stored 


--- Page 8 ---
 
 
in a dry, clean place at a uniform temperature to prevent 
condensation and damage.  
• If practical, further equipment inspections for possible concealed 
damage should be done in the presence of the carrier inspector. If 
not possible while the carrier is on-site, the consignee or an 
affiliated party must inspect the equipment within 15 days of 
receipt. If the concealed damage is found, the consignee party must 
notify the carrier and a carrier inspection must be made before any 
corrective action or repair to remove the observed defects is made. 
Notify the MPS Sales Office immediately of any detected signs of 
damage. 
• After the carrier inspection, the consignee party must obtain the 
original carrier inspection report and send it to the MPS Sales 
Office along with a copy of the noted delivery receipt. Upon 
receiving these two documents, MPS shall obtain approval from 
the carrier to initiate the repair work on the equipment.  
3.4 Handling 
 
 
First, verify the weight of each switchboard shipping section by 
contacting the MPS Sales Office. Then, check the lifting capacity of 
all available hoisting and lifting equipment, and only use the cranes 
and forklifts if their load capacity exceeds the weight of each section. 
Do not use damaged hooks, slings, or cables. Only lift the 
switchboard from the provided lifting provisions, like lifting points 
and lifting bars, on the equipment. The sections can be moved by 
attaching the lifting bars at the top of the switchboard to a crane with at 
least four lift cables. If crane facilities are unavailable due to space or 
budget constraints, rollers can be fitted beneath the skids to facilitate 
movement. Take care when lifting the unit and removing it from the 
truck so it does not get damaged. 
 
A. Lifting By Means of an Overhead Crane 
Lifting brackets are installed at the top and rear positions of the 
switchboard section, as depicted in Figure 3-1. These brackets are 
used to lift the section using overhead cranes. There are two methods 
for lifting the switchboard sections when using an overhead crane, 
depending on the number of sections of the switchboard equipment.  
 
Figure 3-1 Lifting Brackets on Top of Switchboard Sections. 
 
• Single Section Lifting – In this method, the lifting cables are first 
connected to the lifting brackets, as shown in Figure 3-2. A crane 
of sufficient height must be used to ensure that the load angle 
between the horizontal surface of the switchboard section and the 
lifting cables is at least 45 degrees or more when viewed from the 
side of the section.  
 
• Multi-Section Lifting – A multi-section switchboard unit can be 
lifted in the same manner as a single section. However, in this 
method, the lifting cables must be connected to all lifting brackets, as 
shown in Figure 3-3. A crane of sufficient height must be used to 
ensure that the load angle between the horizontal surface of the 
switchboard section and the lifting cables is at least 45 degrees or 
more when viewed from the side of the section.  
 
 
Spreaders may be employed with the lifting cables to prevent the 
brackets from twisting. Figures 3-4 and 3-5 illustrate the use of 
spreader beams for single-section and multi-section lifting, 
respectively.

B. Lifting by Means of a Forklift 
Forklift trucks can easily lift and move switchboard equipment in an 
upright position over short distances. However, they must be used with a 
lot of care, as any improper lift points can cause damage to the 
equipment. Balance the load carefully and use safety straps when 
handling the switchboard equipment with a forklift. Switchboard 
sections properly supported by sturdy timbers can be lifted using jacks. 
Multiple rollers may be used to ensure the unit's weight is distributed 
uniformly throughout the moving process. The path to the installation 
place should be level and free of debris and obstructions. Figure 3-3 
shows the standard procedure for lifting an indoor switchboard using a 
forklift. 
 
 
 
Figure 3-3 Lifting by Means of a Forklift. 
Please refer to the NEMA Standards Publication PB 2.1 for information 
on alternate handling means. 
3.5. Storage 
A. Indoor Switchboards 
If the equipment must be stored for some time prior to installation, the 
equipment should be stored in a dry, clean place with a uniform 
temperature and adequate air circulation to prevent condensation and 
damage. When storing a switchboard for prolonged periods, it should 
be kept upright to avoid distortion or damage to the bottom frame. 
The packing of the switchboard components should be carefully 
removed when performing inspections for possible damage so that the 
packing material can be used to store the equipment until installation. 
If the packing material is damaged, an appropriate cover should be 
placed over the switchboard to protect it from moisture, dust, and 
debris. 
Unlike outdoor switchboards, indoor switchboards are not expected to 
suffer extreme outdoor weather conditions and are, therefore, not 
equipped with similar weatherproof or drip-proof protections. If 
possible, indoor switchboards should only be stored indoors where the 
building walls and roof can provide the required insulation from 
harmful weather conditions.  
If there is a lack of indoor space for storage, the indoor switchboard 
can be stored outdoors if given adequate protection against humidity, 
heat, weather, dirt, and other weather conditions. Indoor switchboards 
are not equipped with space heaters, so heat sources of approximately 
250 watts output must be placed within each vertical switchboard 
section to prevent condensation and damage. However, the heat 
source should only be energized after ensuring no loose packaging or 
flammable materials are inside the switchboard. If the equipment 
must be stored for an extensive period, all moving parts, such as 
shutters, hinges, etc., must be adequately lubricated to prevent rusting.  
 
B. Outdoor Switchboards 
Outdoor switchboards must be stored exactly in the same manner as 
described above for indoor switchboards. If possible, the switchboard 
must be stored indoors for added protection. However, if there is a lack 
of indoor space for storage, the outdoor switchboard can be stored 
outdoors by keeping it dry and clean. The outdoor switchboards are 
equipped to handle outdoor conditions, but additional protection 
should be provided, if possible, to extend their service life. If self-
contained space heaters are provided with a switchboard unit, they must 
be energized to prevent condensation and damage. The vents and 
louvers on the switchboard must be uncovered to allow air to 
circulate, and the shipping splits must be covered to protect them from 
outdoor environmental elements like humidity and dust. Refer to the 
wiring drawing to find the connections needed for the space heater 
circuit. If the equipment must be stored for an extensive period, all 
moving parts, such as shutters, hinges, etc., must be adequately 
lubricated to prevent rusting. 
Installation 
Section 4.0 – Installation 
The proper installation method depends on whether the switchboard 
units are shipped as a single complete group (84.0" or less) or in two or 
more shipping sections. The MPS factory that manufactures a product 
for the consignee also ships a general arrangement drawing to indicate 
the shipping groups and the location of each unit within the group 
lineup. The general arrangement drawing also provides instructions for 
assembling the switchboard units after receiving all sections/ shipping 
group components at the installation site.  
4.1. Location 
The switchboard installation area should be designated on the 
building plan prior to the arrival of the unit. The chosen location must 
provide working clearances in accordance with NEC Article 110.26. 
The equipment drawings provide the means to identify whether the 
switchboard is front-accessible or rear-accessible. If it is front-
accessible, then adequate spacing must be provided on the front side 
of the installation site to allow access to field connections, e.g., the 
mains, ground, branches, and neutral connections. If the switchboard 
is rear accessible, the same spacing must be provided but on the rear 
side of the installation site. 
4.2. Foundation Requirements 
It is pivotal to ensure that the switchboard equipment is placed on a 
strong and sturdy foundation that can adequately support the 
switchboard weight in an upright position so that neither the foundation 
nor the equipment is damaged or deformed. The general arrangement 
drawing provides the exact spacing and location information needed 
to install the required anchor bolts and grouted sills (or bed plates) to 
the support and fix the switchboard on top of the foundation or floor. 
These drawings also provide information for designating an area for 
conduits, the associated limitations, and other general instructions. 
According to NEC 408.5, conduit couplings should be stubbed below 
or level with the finished horizontal floor. After lowering the equipment 
and setting it in place on top of the prepared foundation, the conduit 
extension sleeves may be screwed into these couplings. 
The foundation and grouted sills (or bed plates) should be properly 
aligned and have a smooth horizontal level throughout their lengths so 
that the floor and sills are on the same plane at each point of contact with 
the switchboard equipment. The foundation surface must not protrude 
above the grouted sills or bed plates at any point.  
Usually, outdoor equipment is installed on a concrete pad with a flat 
and even surface. The outdoor equipment must be supported at each 
section if assembled on formed base plates. While preparing the 
foundation, it must be ensured that adjacent units at each shipping 
split are supported by a single support. 
4.3. Positioning of Sections 
Adequate space should be provided in the front and rear of the 
installation site to allow for door opening, installation, and removal of 
breakers, as well as inspection and maintenance activities. The service 
entrance equipment should be positioned near the incoming service of 


--- Page 10 ---
 
 
the building. The process of positioning and connecting the switchboard 
sections at the installation site should follow the below instructions: 
• Before the process can begin, the mounting surface should be 
thoroughly cleaned of any dirt or debris.  
• Refer to this manual's "Handling" section for instructions on 
maneuvering the switchboard sections into the desired positions. 
Start this process from the left-end shipping group and proceed in 
sequence until the right-end group is also in position. Exercise 
caution when moving the switchboard sections over conduit areas, 
as protruding conduits can obstruct the sliding movement of the 
section in either direction. 
• Connections must be made across shipping splits before the final 
placement of the equipment. Remove the bus joints and supports 
using the front, rear, and side access options as necessary. Take 
note of the mounting orientation and position. Save the hardware 
for use in reinstallation. 
• After removing the shipping skid, stand the switchboard section 
upright. Remove all packing material and any present bottom 
floor plates inside or near the section. To safeguard the bottom 
channel, carefully apply a sliding force across the bottom 4 inches 
(100mm) of the side to distribute the sliding force evenly. 
• All shipping sections must be leveled and aligned to each other to 
maintain proper alignment of the horizontal main through bus and 
splice bus connections. Bolt all section frames together and connect 
all through the bus and ground bus at shipping breaks using the 
supplied splice plate bus and hardware. Tighten the bolted 
connections in accordance with the torque specifications indicated 
on the instruction label supplied. 
4.4. Anchoring, Leveling, and Assembly 
The vertical sections of the indoor switchboard shipping groups are 
held together using bolts. The entire shipping group must be leveled 
and anchored as a single structure without loose hardware. The 
supporting surfaces for the switchboard at each anchoring bolt 
location must be level and aligned within the same plane as one 
another. No projections above this plane must be allowed within the 
area covered by the switchboard cubicles. If the floor or ground sill 
channels do not meet this requirement, shims may be required to 
elevate the cubicle and mitigate the impact of protrusions. 
All anchor bolt locations of a cubicle must rest freely over and in firm 
contact with the mounting support surface. There must be no 
projections or obstructions in other areas that could potentially distort 
the cubicle. Do not force a cubicle into firm contact by drastically 
tightening the anchoring bolts because such over-torquing would 
distort the cubicle. Instead, 4" (100mm) square shims may be added 
adjacent to anchor bolts until firm contact is achieved. Verify the 
location of each anchor bolt, as illustrated in Figures 4-1(a), 4-1(b), 
and 4-2. The following steps must be implemented to complete the 
successful anchoring and leveling of the equipment: 
• First, all side-mounted lifting bars on a shipping section must be 
removed unless the shipping sections also include top-mounted 
lifting brackets, in which case the removal becomes optional.  
• Tighten the anchor bolts or weld them to the sills. 
• If the lineup comprises multiple groups, place two groups into 
position, with the rear of one group aligned and tight against the 
adjacent group. The groups must not be bolted together at this 
stage. Ensure that the cubicles are in firm contact with the 
foundation at each corner and anchor point and that the bolt holes 
are aligned. If required, square shims may be added before the 
anchor bolts are tightened. Finally, bolt the groups together as 
outlined in this manual's "Joining Shipping Sections" section. 
• Repeat the above step for the secure installation of all shipping 
groups in the correct order per the front elevation drawing 
supplied by the MPS factory.

4.5. Joining Shipping Sections 
Remove the front panels and, if feasible, the back plates for the secure 
bolting of adjacent shipping section frames. Insert 5/16-16 x 1.00-inch 
steel bolts through the holes in each front and rear corner post in 
accordance with the configuration shown in Figure 4-3. Apply a 
torque of 12 ft-lbs. to tighten the bolts.

4.6. Electrical Connections 
All electrical connections within switchboards are made using cables 
or bus bars. Bus bars are furnished for connecting the main bus, pads 
for cable terminations, and circuit breakers fusible devices. MPS 
Switchboards are designed to comply with accepted industrial 
standards for electrical clearances between energized components. 
However, some cable and bus connections must be made in the field, 
and in such cases, the technicians making the connections must ensure 
that all minimum clearances are maintained according to the
