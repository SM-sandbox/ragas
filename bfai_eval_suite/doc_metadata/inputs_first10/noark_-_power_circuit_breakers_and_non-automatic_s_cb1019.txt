A32 Series Power Circuit Breakers
Trip Unit Overview
A32 Trip Units offer the advanced electronic protection and control functionality 
required for power distribution and feeder protection in today’s increasingly 
complex power systems. The A32 trip unit’s purpose-built electronic circuits and 
microprocessors measure the breaker’s electrical values against pre-set or user- 
selected parameters for overload, short circuit, current unbalance, over/under 
voltage, and over/under frequency. When required, a residual ground current 
transformer provides sensing for ground fault protection.
In addition to the standard LS, LSI and LSIG circuit protection functions, A32 
trip units can offer advanced Digital Metering, Arc Flash Reduction Mode and 
Zone Selective Interlocking. Communications capability is available, ensuring 
that the trip unit’s metered values and status can be transmitted to any required 
monitoring or control networks.
A32 Trip Units consist of three models, each providing different levels of control, display, 
diagnostics, and communications options, meeting the requirements of a wide range of end-use 
applications. Each model can be ordered in one of three protection configurations.
