AcquiSuite EMB A8810
 
WHAT IS IT: 
 
The AcquiSuite is the datalogger that we use on most of our commercial sites. It is able 
to detect and collect data from a variety of external devices. This document will outline 
common checks we can perform externally (without logging into the AcquiSuite with a 
laptop) in order to troubleshoot more efficiently.
 
 
SETTINGS CHECK:
 
The AcquiSuite often uses one of our cellular modems (the Digi or Multitech) to 
connect but can also use a local area network. For local area network connections, 
we can set the AcquiSuite to DHCP mode but if there are specific network 
requirements, they will need to obtain those from the IT department for that 
network.
Common Network Settings for AcquiSuite using our cell modem:
DHCP+UPnP = disabled
IP Address = 192.168.2.50
Netmask = 255.255.255.0

Gateway = 192.168.2.1
DNS Server #1 = 8.8.4.4
DNS Server #2 = 8.8.8.8
Note: These settings are common but there are sites (often retrofits) that use 
different network configurations. If there are differing settings, do not change 
them unless you have confirmed that they are incorrect. If in question, check 
the site drawings and/or check with the AEs.
 
 
MENU LAYOUT:
 
 
MENU NAVIGATION:
 
There are two external buttons on the AcquiSuite, Menu and Select, that are 
located at the top right corner of the unit.
The Menu button is used to scroll through the menu options and Select is used to 
advance into the currently displayed menu option.
After selecting DHCP+UPnP on/off, Menu will disable DHCP and Select will enable 
DHCP mode.
When changing IP addresses in the TCP/IP Config menu, the Select button will 
advance the cursor a single position and the Menu button will scroll through the 
number/character options for the current cursor position.

In order to navigate back to the TCP/IP Config menu, press Select until the
