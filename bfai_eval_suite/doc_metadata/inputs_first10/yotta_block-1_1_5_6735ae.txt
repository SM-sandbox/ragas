- Scalable in 1kWh increments
- Applicable to rooftop ballasted, ﬁxed tilt, ﬂush mount 
and ground mount racking systems
- Plug-and-play for simpliﬁed deployment
- Low-Voltage DC architecture (<60V)
- Slim, light-weight design
- Best in class ﬁre safety
- Compatible with high-capacity PV modules
- High efficiency DC-coupled architecture
- Compatible with 5 & 10 degree ballast racking systems
- Solid-State Design means no annual maintenance required.
- Paired with the Yotta DPI, the YOTTA BLOCK can output either 208V 
or 480V 3-phase power
- Integrates with YOTTA VISION EMA Platform which allows remote 
monitoring, asset management, and trouble shooting.(2) 
Seamlessly integrate storage behind photovoltaic (PV) modules on commercial rooftops with the 1kWh YOTTA BLOCK 
(YB-1). We’ve simpliﬁed battery placement - one of the biggest challenges of the commercial ESS landscape. Our 
proprietary passive thermal regulation technology has enabled the YOTTA BLOCK to be DC coupled, and co-located on 
rooftops and carports adjacent to the PV modules. Our thermal regulation maximizes the life and performance of the 
battery and delivers best-in-class safety. 
 
The YOTTA BLOCK modular design is able to scale to ﬁt any project size to the precise kWh needed, eliminating the 
siting, construction, and O&M headaches of C&I storage! Our plug-and-play design pairs the ESS with Yotta’s native 
three phase DPI microinverters (208V/480V), creating a one-stop solution for commercial savings.
