660-800VAC Balance of System Equipment  
 
     Most Comprehensive Offerings / Up to 70% Domestic Content 
 
EPEC has developed a comprehensive set of solutions available for 660-800VAC AC collection requirements.  Our 
equipment is designed and mfg. in the United States and performs with all inverter brands and sizes (250 / 275 
/ 350kW) presently being sold in the USA.   We realize that one size does not fit all though.  Thus, we have 
crafted solutions for multiple power block / topology layouts.    We illustrate this flexibility below.  The following 
examples are based on a power block size of (4.2MVA), however, block size can reduce as required to meet 
exact solar plant requirements. 
 
 
Main Switchboard / Inverters in Array / Local Disconnect 
EPEC switchboard is located at the transformer (either cable or bus 
connected to MVT).  MCCB’s in the SWBD are cabled out to 
Inverters mounted throughout the array.   EPEC’s 800VAC NF 
disconnect provides required NEC local disconnecting means.  Up 
to (12) 350kW inverters or up to (15) 275kW inverters  are 
connected for a total power block size of 4.2MVA.   Domestic 
content 55-60% for SWBD.  If a skidded (MVT + SWBD) solution 
domestic content 70%. 
Main Switchboard (AC Recombiner) / Field AC Combiner 
EPEC modular (multi-section) switchboard is located at the 
transformer (either cable or bus connected to MVT).  The 
switchboard utilizes 800VAC rated air circuit breakers ACB (800A – 
1200A).  These (4) ACB’s are fed by field mounted AC combiners, 
each of which can combine up to (3) 350kW inverters or (4) 275kW 
inverters for a total power block size of 4.2MVA. Domestic content 
70%, if skidded (MVT + SWBD) or integrated rack (AC combiner  + 
INV) solution domestic content 80%. 
Main Switchboard / Field Inverter Cluster with PICS 1000A 
EPEC “main breaker only” switchboard is located a the 
transformer (either cable or bus connected to MVT).  The load bus 
of the switchboard has load landing positions for up to 8x 
1000MCM cables.   Inverters are clustered in the field and 
combined with EPEC PICS 1000A fusible disconnect.  Up to (4) PICS 
units can combine up to (12) 350kW or (15) 275kW inverters for a 
total power block size of 4.2MVA.   Domestic content 50%, if 
skidded (MVT + SWBD) or integrated rack (PICS + INV) solution 
domestic content 70%+.

660-800VAC BoS – 4.2MVA Power Block Skids 
 
Made in USA with up to 70% Domestic Content 
EPEC provides complete power block skids, assembled & integrated in our North Carolina facilities. These skids utilize our 
switchboards, domestically sourced MV transformers and LV auxiliary power centers.  (Non-domestic MV transformers 
available if domestic content is not a consideration.)
