NEP’s BDM-550 & BDM-650 
Microinverters
...to enable more power while avoiding 
sub-panel upgrade thresholds
these models complement the BDM-800 
ideal for modules over 400Wdc
 
The residential solar industry includes a myriad of hurdles that can cause setbacks both monetarily and in meeting 
deadlines. One major hurdle being main panel upgrades, which largely affects the smaller service ratings such as the 
100A service panels.  
Why 100A Panels Often Need Upgrading 
•
Limited capacity: A 100A panel may not support the additional load from solar back-feed, especially if the home
already has high electrical demand.
•
120% Rule: NEC guidelines allow solar back-feed up to 120% of the panel rating. For a 100A panel, that’s only
20A of allowable back-feed.
Upgrading a service panel can cost thousands on top of an already costly PV system and can delay project completions 
weeks, even months, in some cases. NEP has a solution that is cost effective and that helps to avoid these additional 
expenses and delayed completion timelines. 
Strategic Advantages of NEP’s BDM-550 & BDM-650 Microinverters 
•
Avoids panel upgrade: By optimizing the AC output current by precise divisibility into the maximum back-feed
capacity, these models help stay within the 120% rule for back-feed on 100A panels.
•
Flexible system design: Dual input microinverters reduce the number of branch circuits needed, simplifying
layout and permitting.
•
Cost-effective scaling: Especially with the BDM-550 & BDM-650, installers can deploy more units per circuit,
maximizing system size without triggering main panel upgrades.

Advanced MLPE Solutions for High-Wattage Module PV Systems 
NEP’s BDM-550 and BDM-650 microinverters are optimized for homes with 100A panels, delivering high-efficiency solar 
without triggering costly electrical upgrades. Their low current draw and dual-panel support make them ideal for 
maximizing output while staying compliant with NEC back-feed limits. 
When dealing with a 100A/100A main panel, here’s how NEP’s BDM-550 and BDM-650 microinverters offer distinct 
advantages that help mitigate the need for costly panel upgrades.
