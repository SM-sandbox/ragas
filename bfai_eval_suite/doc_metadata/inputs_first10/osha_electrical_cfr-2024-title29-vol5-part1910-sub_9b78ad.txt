§ 1910.303 
§ 1910.303
General. 
(a) Approval. The conductors and 
equipment required or permitted by 
this subpart shall be acceptable only if 
approved, as defined in § 1910.399. 
(b) Examination, installation, and use 
of equipment—(1) Examination. Electric 
equipment shall be free from recog-
nized hazards that are likely to cause 
death or serious physical harm to em-
ployees. Safety of equipment shall be 
determined using the following consid-
erations: 
(i) Suitability for installation and 
use in conformity with the provisions 
of this subpart; 
NOTE TO PARAGRAPH (b)(1)(i) OF THIS SEC-
TION: Suitability of equipment for an identi-
fied purpose may be evidenced by listing or 
labeling for that identified purpose. 
(ii) Mechanical strength and dura-
bility, including, for parts designed to 
enclose and protect other equipment, 
the adequacy of the protection thus 
provided; 
(iii) Wire-bending and connection 
space; 
(iv) Electrical insulation; 
(v) Heating effects under all condi-
tions of use; 
(vi) Arcing effects; 
(vii) Classification by type, size, volt-
age, current capacity, and specific use; 
and 
(viii) Other factors that contribute to 
the practical safeguarding of persons 
using or likely to come in contact with 
the equipment. 
(2) Installation and use. Listed or la-
beled equipment shall be installed and 
used in accordance with any instruc-
tions included in the listing or label-
ing. 
(3) Insulation integrity. Completed 
wiring installations shall be free from 
short circuits and from grounds other 
than those required or permitted by 
this subpart. 
(4) Interrupting rating. Equipment in-
tended to interrupt current at fault 
levels shall have an interrupting rating 
sufficient for the nominal circuit volt-
age and the current that is available at 
the line terminals of the equipment. 
Equipment intended to interrupt cur-
rent at other than fault levels shall 
have an interrupting rating at nominal 
circuit voltage sufficient for the cur-
rent that must be interrupted. 
(5) Circuit impedance and other charac-
teristics. The overcurrent protective de-
vices, the total impedance, the compo-
nent short-circuit current ratings, and 
other characteristics of the circuit to 
be protected shall be selected and co-
ordinated to permit the circuit protec-
tive devices used to clear a fault to do 
so without the occurrence of extensive 
damage to the electrical components of 
the circuit. This fault shall be assumed 
to be either between two or more of the 
circuit conductors, or between any cir-
cuit conductor and the grounding con-
ductor or enclosing metal raceway. 
(6) Deteriorating agents. Unless identi-
fied for use in the operating environ-
ment, no conductors or equipment 
shall be located in damp or wet loca-
tions; where exposed to gases, fumes, 
vapors, liquids, or other agents that 
have a deteriorating effect on the con-
ductors or equipment; or where exposed 
to excessive temperatures. 
(7) Mechanical execution of work. Elec-
tric equipment shall be installed in a 
neat and workmanlike manner. 
(i) Unused openings in boxes, race-
ways, 
auxiliary 
gutters, 
cabinets, 
equipment cases, or housings shall be 
effectively closed to afford protection 
substantially equivalent to the wall of 
the equipment. 
(ii) Conductors shall be racked to 
provide ready and safe access in under-
ground and subsurface enclosures that 
persons 
enter 
for 
installation 
and 
maintenance. 
(iii) 
Internal 
parts 
of 
electrical 
equipment, including busbars, wiring 
terminals, insulators, and other sur-
faces, may not be damaged or contami-
nated by foreign materials such as 
paint, plaster, cleaners, abrasives, or 
corrosive residues. 
(iv) There shall be no damaged parts 
that may adversely affect safe oper-
ation or mechanical strength of the 
equipment, such as parts that are bro-
ken, bent, cut, or deteriorated by cor-
rosion, 
chemical 
action, 
or 
over-
heating. 
(8) Mounting and cooling of equipment. 
(i) Electric equipment shall be firmly 
secured to the surface on which it is 
mounted.

§ 1910.303 
NOTE TO PARAGRAPH (b)(8)(i) OF THIS SEC-
TION: Wooden plugs driven into holes in ma-
sonry, concrete, plaster, or similar materials 
are not considered secure means of fastening 
electric equipment. 
(ii) Electric equipment that depends 
on the natural circulation of air and 
convection principles for cooling of ex-
posed surfaces shall be installed so that 
room airflow over such surfaces is not 
prevented by walls or by adjacent in-
stalled equipment. For equipment de-
signed for floor mounting, clearance 
between top surfaces and adjacent sur-
faces shall be provided to dissipate ris-
ing warm air. 
(iii) 
Electric 
equipment 
provided 
with ventilating openings shall be in-
stalled so that walls or other obstruc-
tions do not prevent the free circula-
tion of air through the equipment. 
(c) Electrical connections—(1) General. 
Because of different characteristics of 
dissimilar metals: 
(i) Devices such as pressure terminal 
or pressure splicing connectors and sol-
dering lugs shall be identified for the 
material of the conductor and shall be 
properly installed and used; 
(ii) Conductors of dissimilar metals 
may not be intermixed in a terminal or 
splicing connector where physical con-
tact occurs between dissimilar conduc-
tors (such as copper and aluminum, 
copper and copper-clad aluminum, or 
aluminum and copper-clad aluminum) 
unless the device is identified for the 
purpose and conditions of use; and 
(iii) Materials such as solder, fluxes, 
inhibitors, and compounds, where em-
ployed, shall be suitable for the use and 
shall be of a type that will not ad-
versely affect the conductors, installa-
tion, or equipment. 
(2) Terminals. (i) Connection of con-
ductors to terminal parts shall ensure 
a good connection without damaging 
the conductors and shall be made by 
means of pressure connectors (includ-
ing set-screw type), solder lugs, or 
splices to flexible leads. However, No. 
10 or smaller conductors may be con-
nected by means of wire binding screws 
or studs and nuts having upturned lugs 
or equivalent. 
(ii) Terminals for more than one con-
ductor and terminals used to connect 
aluminum shall be so identified. 
(3) Splices. (i) Conductors shall be 
spliced or joined with splicing devices 
identified for the use or by brazing, 
welding, or soldering with a fusible 
metal or alloy. Soldered splices shall 
first be spliced or joined to be mechani-
cally and electrically secure without 
solder and then soldered. All splices 
and joints and the free ends of conduc-
tors shall be covered with an insulation 
equivalent to that of the conductors or 
with an insulating device identified for 
the purpose. 
(ii) 
Wire 
connectors 
or 
splicing 
means installed on conductors for di-
rect burial shall be listed for such use. 
(d) Arcing parts. Parts of electric 
equipment that in ordinary operation 
produce arcs, sparks, flames, or molten 
metal shall be enclosed or separated 
and isolated from all combustible ma-
terial.
