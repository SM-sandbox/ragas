OSHA considers equipment to be an arc hazard if it has loose parts, is sticking, or \"otherwise exhibits signs of lack of maintenance\" [Document 17].\n\n3.  **Improper Equipment Procedures**: Unsafe actions performed by personnel during maintenance or servicing are a frequent cause of arc flash. Examples include the \"Incorrect racking or removal of breakers,\" defeating or bypassing safety interlocks, and failing to verify the absence of voltage before starting work [Document 6, Document 15].
