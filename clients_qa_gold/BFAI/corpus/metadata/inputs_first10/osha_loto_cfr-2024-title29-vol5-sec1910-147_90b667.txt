§ 1910.147 
service should perform a critique of the prac-
tice rescue, or have another qualified party 
perform the critique, so that deficiencies in 
procedures, equipment, training, or number 
of personnel can be identified and corrected. 
The results of the critique, and the correc-
tions made to respond to the deficiencies 
identified, should be given to the employer 
to enable it to determine whether the rescue 
service can quickly be upgraded to meet the 
employer’s rescue needs or whether another 
service must be selected. The following ques-
tions will assist employers and rescue teams 
and services evaluate their performance. 
1. Have all members of the service been 
trained as permit space entrants, at a min-
imum, including training in the potential 
hazards of all permit spaces, or of represent-
ative permit spaces, from which rescue may 
be needed? Can team members recognize the 
signs, symptoms, and consequences of expo-
sure to any hazardous atmospheres that may 
be present in those permit spaces? 
2. Is every team member provided with, 
and properly trained in, the use and need for 
PPE, such as SCBA or fall arrest equipment, 
which may be required to perform permit 
space rescues in the facility? Is every team 
member properly trained to perform his or 
her functions and make rescues, and to use 
any rescue equipment, such as ropes and 
backboards, that may be needed in a rescue 
attempt? 
3. Are team members trained in the first 
aid and medical skills needed to treat vic-
tims overcome or injured by the types of 
hazards that may be encountered in the per-
mit spaces at the facility? 
4. Do all team members perform their func-
tions safely and efficiently? Do rescue serv-
ice personnel focus on their own safety be-
fore considering the safety of the victim? 
5. If necessary, can the rescue service prop-
erly test the atmosphere to determine if it is 
IDLH? 
6. Can the rescue personnel identify infor-
mation pertinent to the rescue from entry 
permits, hot work permits, and MSDSs? 
7. Has the rescue service been informed of 
any hazards to personnel that may arise 
from outside the space, such as those that 
may be caused by future work near the 
space? 
8. If necessary, can the rescue service prop-
erly package and retrieve victims from a 
permit space that has a limited size opening 
(less than 24 inches (60.9 cm) in diameter), 
limited internal space, or internal obstacles 
or hazards? 
9. If necessary, can the rescue service safe-
ly perform an elevated (high angle) rescue? 
10. Does the rescue service have a plan for 
each of the kinds of permit space rescue op-
erations at the facility? Is the plan adequate 
for all types of rescue operations that may 
be needed at the facility? Teams may prac-
tice in representative spaces, or in spaces 
that are ‘‘worst-case’’ or most restrictive 
with respect to internal configuration, ele-
vation, and portal size. The following charac-
teristics of a practice space should be consid-
ered when deciding whether a space is truly 
representative of an actual permit space: 
(1) Internal configuration. 
(a) Open—there are no obstacles, barriers, 
or obstructions within the space. One exam-
ple is a water tank. 
(b) Obstructed—the permit space contains 
some type of obstruction that a rescuer 
would need to maneuver around. An example 
would be a baffle or mixing blade. Large 
equipment, such as a ladder or scaffold, 
brought into a space for work purposes 
would be considered an obstruction if the po-
sitioning or size of the equipment would 
make rescue more difficult. 
(2) Elevation. 
(a) Elevated—a permit space where the en-
trance portal or opening is above grade by 4 
feet or more. This type of space usually re-
quires knowledge of high angle rescue proce-
dures because of the difficulty in packaging 
and transporting a patient to the ground 
from the portal. 
(b) Non-elevated—a permit space with the 
entrance portal located less than 4 feet above 
grade. This type of space will allow the res-
cue team to transport an injured employee 
normally. 
(3) Portal size. 
(a) Restricted—A portal of 24 inches or less 
in the least dimension. Portals of this size 
are too small to allow a rescuer to simply 
enter the space while using SCBA. The por-
tal size is also too small to allow normal spi-
nal immobilization of an injured employee. 
(b) Unrestricted—A portal of greater than 
24 inches in the least dimension. These por-
tals allow relatively free movement into and 
out of the permit space. 
(4) Space access. 
(a) Horizontal—The portal is located on 
the side of the permit space. Use of retrieval 
lines could be difficult. 
(b) Vertical—The portal is located on the 
top of the permit space, so that rescuers 
must climb down, or the bottom of the per-
mit space, so that rescuers must climb up to 
enter the space. Vertical portals may require 
knowledge of rope techniques, or special pa-
tient packaging to safely retrieve a downed 
entrant.

stalled, energy isolating devices for 
such machine or equipment shall be de-
signed to accept a lockout device. 
(3) Full employee protection. (i) When a 
tagout device is used on an energy iso-
lating device which is capable of being 
locked out, the tagout device shall be 
attached at the same location that the 
lockout device would have been at-
tached, and the employer shall dem-
onstrate that the tagout program will 
provide a level of safety equivalent to 
that obtained by using a lockout pro-
gram. 
(ii) In demonstrating that a level of 
safety is achieved in the tagout pro-
gram which is equivalent to the level 
of safety obtained by using a lockout 
program, the employer shall dem-
onstrate 
full 
compliance 
with 
all 
tagout-related provisions of this stand-
ard together with such additional ele-
ments as are necessary to provide the 
equivalent safety available from the 
use of a lockout device. Additional 
means to be considered as part of the 
demonstration of full employee protec-
tion shall include the implementation 
of additional safety measures such as 
the removal of an isolating circuit ele-
ment, blocking of a controlling switch, 
opening of an extra disconnecting de-
vice, or the removal of a valve handle

§ 1910.147 
(B) When a tag is attached to an en-
ergy isolating means, it is not to be re-
moved without authorization of the au-
thorized person responsible for it, and 
it is never to be bypassed, ignored, or 
otherwise defeated. 
(C) Tags must be legible and under-
standable by all authorized employees, 
affected employees, and all other em-
ployees whose work operations are or 
may be in the area, in order to be effec-
tive. 
(D) Tags and their means of attach-
ment must be made of materials which 
will withstand the environmental con-
ditions encountered in the workplace. 
(E) Tags may evoke a false sense of 
security, and their meaning needs to be 
understood as part of the overall en-
ergy control program. 
(F) Tags must be securely attached 
to energy isolating devices so that they 
cannot be inadvertently or acciden-
tally detached during use. 
(iii) Employee retraining. 
(A) Retraining shall be provided for 
all authorized and affected employees 
whenever there is a change in their job 
assignments, a change in machines, 
equipment or processes that present a 
new hazard, or when there is a change 
in the energy control procedures. 
(B) Additional retraining shall also 
be conducted whenever a periodic in-
spection under paragraph (c)(6) of this 
section reveals, or whenever the em-
ployer has reason to believe, that there 
are deviations from or inadequacies in 
the employee’s knowledge or use of the 
energy control procedures. 
(C) The retraining shall reestablish 
employee proficiency and introduce 
new or revised control methods and 
procedures, as necessary. 
(iv) The employer shall certify that 
employee training has been accom-
plished and is being kept up to date. 
The certification shall contain each 
employee’s name and dates of training.

Lockout 
or 
tagout shall be performed only by the 
authorized employees who are per-
forming the servicing or maintenance. 
(9) Notification of employees. Affected 
employees shall be notified by the em-
ployer or authorized employee of the 
application and removal of lockout de-
vices or tagout devices. Notification 
shall be given before the controls are 
applied, and after they are removed 
from the machine or equipment. 
(d) Application of control. The estab-
lished procedures for the application of 
energy control (the lockout or tagout 
procedures) shall cover the following 
elements and actions and shall be done 
in the following sequence: 
(1) Preparation for shutdown. Before 
an authorized or affected employee 
turns off a machine or equipment, the 
authorized employee shall have knowl-
edge of the type and magnitude of the 
energy, the hazards of the energy to be 
controlled, and the method or means to 
control the energy. 
(2) Machine or equipment shutdown. 
The machine or equipment shall be 
turned off or shut down using the pro-
cedures established for the machine or 
equipment. An orderly shutdown must 
be utilized to avoid any additional or

APPENDIX A TO § 1910.147—TYPICAL MINIMAL 
LOCKOUT PROCEDURE 
General 
The following simple lockout procedure is 
provided to assist employers in developing 
their procedures so they meet the require-
ments of this standard. When the energy iso-
lating devices are not lockable, tagout may 
be used, provided the employer complies 
with the provisions of the standard which re-
quire additional training and more rigorous 
periodic inspections. When tagout is used 
and the energy isolating devices are lock-
able, the employer must provide full em-
ployee protection (see paragraph (c)(3)) and 
additional training and more rigorous peri-
odic inspections are required. For more com-
plex systems, more comprehensive proce-
dures may need to be developed, documented 
and utilized.

Purpose 
This procedure establishes the minimum 
requirements for the lockout of energy iso-
lating devices whenever maintenance or 
servicing is done on machines or equipment. 
It shall be used to ensure that the machine 
or equipment is stopped, isolated from all 
potentially hazardous energy sources and 
locked out before employees perform any 
servicing or maintenance where the unex-
pected energization or start-up of the ma-
chine or equipment or release of stored en-
ergy could cause injury.
