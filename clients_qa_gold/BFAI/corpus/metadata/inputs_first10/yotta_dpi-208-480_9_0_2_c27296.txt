Yotta's Dual Power Inverters (DPI-208 and DPI-480) are native 3-phase microinverters that each support four (4) high 
capacity solar modules and deliver outstanding performance. The internals are protected with silicone to reduce 
stress on the electronics, increase its waterproof properties, dissipate heat, and to provide maximum system 
reliability. Yotta’s DPI-208 and DPI-480 are powerful plug-and-play MLPE inverters that install faster than any other 
solution in the market and comply with rapid shutdown requirements. Their design improves thermal dissipation while 
maximizing power production.

(1) Nominal voltage/frequency range can be extended  beyond nominal if required by the utility.                                                 
(2) Limits may vary. Refer to local requirements to deﬁne the number of microinverters per branch in your area. 
(3) Inverter may enter low power mode in environments with poor ventilation or limited heat dissipation
(4) Recommend no more than 80 inverters register to one ECU for stable communication. "
