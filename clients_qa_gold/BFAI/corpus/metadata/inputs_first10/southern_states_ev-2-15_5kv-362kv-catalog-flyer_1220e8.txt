EV-2
Aluminum Vertical
Disconnect Switch
Highly Versatile, Robust Design That 
Promotes Maximum Reliability
The Southern States EV-2 aluminum vertical break disconnect switch can be used 
for any conventional air break switch application, including disconnecting and 
sectionalizing lines and isolating or bypassing equipment. Installation is simple, 
consisting principally of aligning the insulators, using easy-to-adjust jack screws, 
and installating the operating pipes which are delivered to the job site pre-cut to 
proper lengths. Generally applied as a three-phase solution, the switch can be 
mounted upright, vertically, or underhung. 
BENEFITS
• Meets all ANSI standards 
• Easily accommodates full load break devices and other accessories
• Good for over 2000 operations 
• Easy and fast installation and adjustment
• Maintenance free, long lasting and low operating effort
• Higher terminal pad loading allowing for long bus length
• Shipped assembled on insulators or with pre-assembled live parts bolted to the 	
  switch base for simplified receipt and installation
