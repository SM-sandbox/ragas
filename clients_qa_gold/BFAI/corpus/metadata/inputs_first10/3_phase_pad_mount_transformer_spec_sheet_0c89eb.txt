Construction
Design Specifications 
Pad-mount transformers are ground-mounted distribution transformers enclosed in a metal cabinet,
 
usually located on a concrete pad. This type of transformer,
 enclosed in a grounded metal box with all 
live contact points,
 can be installed in residential areas without fencing,
 unlike transformers in 
substations. 
MPS'

MPS'
 pad mount transformers are protected against tampering and the weather,
 so they can be safely 
placed where people are present. All enclosures are made from heavy gauge sheet steel and powder 
painted with a baked-on coating to make them tamper-resistant. Our pad mount transformers come in 
live-front and dead-front designs along with radial or loop feed.
Our transformers are made of high-grade materials and typically support residential,
 commercial,
 and 
industrial loads in cities and rural areas. They are filled with sustainable and biodegradable dielectric 
fluid,
 which offers excellent fire protection and a longer lifespan.
MPS manufactu
MPS manufactures a full variety of liquid-filled Three-Phase Pad-Mounted distribution transformers 
that comply with ANSI/IEEE standards.
