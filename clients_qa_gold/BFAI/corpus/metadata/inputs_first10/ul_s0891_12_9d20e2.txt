Preface
This is the harmonized ANCE, CSA Group, and UL standard for Switchboards. It is the Fourth edition of
NMX-J-118/2-ANCE, the Second edition of CSA-C22.2 No. 244, and the Twelfth edition of UL 891. This
edition of NMX-J-118/2-ANCE supersedes the previous edition published on October 31, 2012. This
edition of CSA-C22.2 No. 244 supersedes the previous edition published on July 26, 2005. This edition of
UL 891 supersedes the previous edition published on July 26, 2005.
This harmonized standard was prepared by the Association of Standardization and Certification, (ANCE),
CSA Group and Underwriters Laboratories Inc. (UL). The efforts and support of the Technical
Harmonization
Subcommittee,
17D
–
Panelboard
and
Switchboard
on
the
Harmonization
of
Electrotechnical Standards of the Nations of the Americas (CANENA), are gratefully acknowledged.
This standard is considered suitable for use for conformity assessment within the stated scope of the
standard.
The present Mexican standard was developed by the CT CDI Control y Distribucion Industrial from the
Comite de Normalizacion de la Asociacion de Normalizacion y Certificacion, A.C., CONANCE, with the
collaboration of the switchboard manufacturers and users.
This standard was reviewed by CSA C232(ICSP) – Integrated Committee on Switchgear Products, under
the jurisdiction of the CSA Technical Committee on Industrial Products and the CSA Strategic Steering
Committee on requirements for Electrical Safety, and has been formally approved by the CSA Technical
Committee. This standard has been developed in compliance with Standards Council of Canada
requirements for National Standards of Canada. It has been published as a National Standard of Canada
by CSA Group.
Application of Standard
Where reference is made to a specific number of samples to be tested, the specified number is to be
considered a minimum quantity.
Note: Although the intended primary application of this standard is stated in its scope, it is important to note that it remains the
responsibility of the users of the standard to judge its suitability for their particular purpose.
Level of harmonization
This standard is published as an equivalent standard for ANCE, CSA Group and UL.
An equivalent standard is a standard that is substantially the same in technical content, except as follows:
Technical national differences are allowed for codes and governmental regulations as well as those
recognized as being in accordance with NAFTA Article 905, for example, because of fundamental climatic,
geographical, technological, or infrastructural factors, scientific justification, or the level of protection that
the country considers appropriate. Presentation is word for word except for editorial changes.
Interpretations
The interpretation by the standards development organization of an identical or equivalent standard is
based on the literal text to determine compliance with the standard in accordance with the procedural rules
of the standards development organization. If more than one interpretation of the literal text has been
identified, a revision is to be proposed as soon as possible to each of the standards development
organizations to more accurately reflect the intent.
