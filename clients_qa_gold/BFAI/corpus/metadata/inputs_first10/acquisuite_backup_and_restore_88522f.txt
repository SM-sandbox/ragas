Acquisuite Backup and Restore
Backing Up An Acquisuite
1. While logged into the Acquisuite, drop down the “System” item and then choose “Backup / Restore”.
2. Click the “Create Backup” button which will download a .bak file to your computer. If you rename the backup file, be sure not to include any spaces as this will
prevent the restore from working. Don’t worry about the checkboxes as those are used for the restore.
3. In PowerTrack, create a folder under the site labeled “Acquisuite Backups”, and then choose add file under that folder.
 
4. Once you’re in the add file box, choose select file. By default, PowerTrack won’t let you see files that end in “.bak”, so you’ll need to select “All Files (*.*)” from
the dropdown box for file types. Once you select the .bak file you downloaded, you can select OK to upload it to PowerTrack. That’s it, you’re done!
