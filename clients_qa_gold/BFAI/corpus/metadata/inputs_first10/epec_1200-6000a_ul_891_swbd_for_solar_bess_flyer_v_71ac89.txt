PRODUCT DETAILS 
Intelligence for Diagnostics, Metering and Switching 
Our switchboards utilize Siemens’ state-of-the-art 
power (3WA) and molded case (3VA6) circuit breakers.   
Full metering and diagnostics for each circuit is available 
from advanced trip units.  The information is easily 
made available to via Modbus TCPTM or other ethernet / 
PLC protocol. If advanced communication is not 
required standard trip units are available.
