EV-2H
Aluminum Vertical
Disconnect Switch
550 kV - 800 kV
Robust Current Transfer & Hinge 
Mechanism Promote Maximum Reliability
Southern States’ latest innovation, the EV-2H, supports reliability through its unique 
design. This heavy duty, highly efficient vertical break disconnect switch utilizes 
independent mechanical and electrical systems to produce the strongest possible 
design with the easiest accessible maintenance.  An over toggle mechanism in both 
open and closed positions prevents the possibility for the blade to close in extreme 
weather and increases down force for high fault performance.  Metal encased coil 
spring counterbalances reduce operating effort, are impervious to weather, and 
prevent catastrophic failure that is possible with linear springs.  Using an all stainless 
steel bearing also ensures a long life in all operating conditions.
BENEFITS
• Mechanical operation is independent of the moving current joints, allowing efficient  
   high current transmitting that promotes switch reliability and useful life.  
• Superior mechanical strength & corrosion resistance 
• Self-cleaning roller bearings & reverse loop current contacts 
• Hinge over-toggle prevents closing in adverse weather conditions and utilizes high  
  downward force on the blade to prevent it from popping open
