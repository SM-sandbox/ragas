Three-Phase Pad-Mounted Transformers
Introduction
Applications
Meta-Power Solutions’ three-phase pad-mounted 
transformers are powerful, dependable, and designed with 
the environment in mind. With the ability to function indoor 
and outdoor, this transformer offers enhanced reliability 
and protection against critical equipment failure. The lower 
operating costs and heat emissions of this transformer 
make it an ideal choice for a wide range of applications.
MPS’ pad mount transformers are protected against 
tampering and the weather, so they can be safely placed 
where people are present. All enclosures are made from 
heavy gauge sheet steel and powder painted with a baked-
on coating to make them tamper-resistant. Our pad mount 
transformers come in live-front and dead-front designs 
along with radial or loop feed.
Our transformers are made of premium materials and 
typically support residential, commercial, and industrial 
loads in cities and rural areas. They are filled with 
sustainable and biodegradable dielectric fluid, which offers 
excellent fire protection and a longer lifespan.
MPS primarily serves utilities (step-down transformer), 
bitcoin miners (step-down transformer with 415 V (Y) 
on the load-side), and solar power facilities (step-up 
transformer) across North America. For almost two 
decades, MPS, a transformer manufacturer in the United 
States, has been designing and manufacturing three-
phase, liquid-filled, pad-mounted distribution transformers. 
Our transformer designs are suitable for a wide range 
of applications, including those involving hazardous 
environments. Our pad-mounted transformers come in live-
front and dead-front designs along with radial or loop-feed 
applications.

Meta-Power Solutions solar transformers are 
designed for installations in all environmental 
conditions and can be used for indoor and 
outdoor applications. Get in touch with MPS 
for unusual operating conditions like:
Abnormal transient voltages on the 
source voltage
Scheduled overloading in compliance 
with the IEEE loading guide 
Motors with a horsepower rating greater 
than half the transformer’s kVA rating
Abnormal impact loading when feeding 
welding equipment, electric furnaces or 
motors with cyclical loads
Loads with abnormal harmonics that 
can occur when solid-state or similar 
power-electronics devices control the 
load currents
Temperature is one of the main factors 
affecting the transformer’s life. In reality, 
a higher temperature is the main factor 
contributing to a shorter transformer life.
The term “transformer’s temperature rise” 
refers to the average increase in winding 
temperature above the ambient temperature 
when the transformer is fully loaded. The 
maximum values are determined by applied 
standards.
There are two standard rises for liquid-
filled transformers, 55oC and 65oC. These 
figures are based on a maximum ambient 
temperature of 40 oC.

Three-Phase Pad-Mounted Transformers
Types of Insulating Fluids
Minimum and Specific Dimensions
Standard Features of a Pad-Mounted Transformer
A liquid-immersed transformer is generally used outdoors due to concerns over oil spills 
or fires if the oil reaches its flash point level. Recently, new insulating liquids (e.g., silicone 
fluid, FR3) have been developed with a higher flashpoint temperature than mineral oil, and 
transformers with such liquids can be used indoors. However, it is important to note that 
these less-flammable liquid-immersed transformers have higher initial costs relative to 
their dry-type counterparts, preventing their widespread market adoption.
For transformer applications, silicone is ideal because of its heat stability, material 
compatibility, low flammability, and low toxicity. Silicone’s high fire point of 340 oC makes 
it a less flammable fluid that is UL Listed and factory mutual approved for indoor and 
outdoor applications. It is ideal in locations where fire hazards are present and special 
fire-suppression systems are in place.
The FR3 dielectric fluid is fully biodegradable and environmentally friendly. It is 
appropriate for indoor use and for areas with high environmental sensitivity where any 
spilled insulating fluid could require extensive cleanup.
There are two configurations for deadfront design: minimum dimensions 
and specific dimensions. The minimum dimensions cover minimum 
bushing spacing, bushing height, and compartment depth. In contrast, the 
specific dimensions cover dimensions other than the minimum ones while 
considering the installations, maintenance, and ease of connections.

Fluid Properties Comparison
FR3 Fluid
Transformer fluid has a direct impact on the operation of the components as well as the cooling efficiency of the transformer. Three types of transformer fluid are used 
in pad-mount distribution transformers: mineral oil, silicone liquid and Envirotemp FR3 insulating oil. These three classes of oil are compared from the environmental 
protection, reliability, fire safety, and maintenance standpoint. It offers a solid basis for choosing the transformer fluid.

Three-Phase Pad-Mounted Transformers
NEC Guidelines for Less-Flammable Liquid-Filled Transformers Installation 
NEC (NFPA) Recognition
These guidelines cover the requirements of NEC® Article 450.23 for 
installing less-flammable liquid-insulated transformers. Transformers 
that require an additional level of fire safety employ less-flammable 
liquids. Typical applications involve indoor installations near buildings, 
forest fire-prone areas, and pedestrian areas.
Less-flammable liquids, or high-fire point liquids, are transformer 
dielectric coolants with a minimum fire point of 300 oC. Dimethysiloxane 
and ester-based fluids are two widely used less-flammable fluids. 
Currently, less-flammable liquids and liquid-filled transformers are 
listed by two Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratories (NRTLs); 
Underwriters Laboratories (UL) and FM Global (FM).
In 1978, the NEC officially recognized less-flammable liquid-filled 
transformers for indoor deployment. In 1990, the NEC included 
particular less-flammable transformer criteria for outdoor applications 
in Article 450.23. Less-flammable transformers, long recognized as 
an additional safety measure for indoor installations, are now being 
considered for outdoor installations as well.
Table. NEC Article 450.23 Less-Flammable Liquid Insulated Transformer Requirements
NEC Requirements
The NEC 450.27 sets out requirements for mineral oil insulated transformers deployed outdoors. 
Depending on the degree of a fire hazard the transformer installation poses, one or more of the 
following safety measures will be implemented:
               Space constraints.
               Fire-resistant barriers.
               Systems for automatic fire suppression.
               Containers that keep the oil from a damaged transformer tank.
According to NEC Article 450.28, “Modification of Transformers,” when transformers are 
modified in existing installations that change the type of transformer, the transformers must 
be marked to indicate the kind of insulating liquid installed, and the installations must also 
adhere to the most current NEC requirements. Examples of modifications include replacing a 
transformer entirely (retrofitting) or just the liquid (retrofilling). 
Transformers filled with mineral oil or Askarel (PCB) are frequently retrofitted or refilled with less 
flammable fluids. NEC 110.34 specifies the minimum dimensions of a clear workspace around 
transformers.

Three-Phase Pad-Mounted Transformers
UL Classification Marking for FR3 Fluid
The Envirotemp FR-3 fluid is a biodegradable ester naturally derived from renewable vegetable oils. It has good heat absorption 
qualities that make it a suitable replacement for mineral oil as transformer oil. The FR-3 fluid is typically used in Pad-mounted 
transformers due to its High Fire Point tolerance and excellent Dielectric characteristics. Transformers that use the FR-3 fluid are 
often labelled with the FR3™ decal on their air compartment doors to distinguish them from other transformers that do not. This decal 
is shown in the figure below, and a transformer with this decal must only ever be filled with more FR-3 when needed. Filling these 
transformers with mineral oils would hamper the device’s capabilities. The FR-3 fluid is also a more environmentally friendly choice for 
transformer oils compared to mineral oils due to its biodegradability. 
The National Electrical Code also classifies the FR-3 fluid as a “less-flammable liquid” when used in three-phase transformers of 
various ratings, specifically from 45 to 10,000 kVA transformers. In such cases, the operation of the fluid is dependent on the following 
restrictions:
The fluid can be used in three-
phase transformers only if they 
have suitable tanks, i.e., they 
must be capable of supporting an 
internal pressure of 12 pounds per 
square inch without rupturing.
The transformer tank must be 
equipped with a pressure relief 
device, which must be capable 
of limiting the internal pressure 
buildup as per the following 
table, so it can prevent any tank 
damage, or even a rupture, due to 
gas accumulation which may be 
caused due to low current arcing 
faults.
Current-limiting Fuses, having 
I2t characteristics not violating 
the values in the following table, 
must be used on the transformer’s 
primary windings. For additional 
security, under-fluid expulsion 
fuses may also be used in series 
with the current-limiting fuses. 
Overcurrent protection, having 
I2t characteristics not violating 
the values in the following table, 
must be used on the transformer’s 
primary windings. The fuse must 
be attached from outside the 
transformer tank, so there is 
enough clearing from the main 
body in case the fuse is designed 
to vent when operated, e.g., the 
expulsion fuse.

Three-Phase Pad-Mounted Transformers
Bay-O-Net Fuse
The Bay-O-Net fuse is a single-phase disconnecting 
device with a dead-front design that adds to the 
security requirements needed to operate the 
fuse manually with a hot stick (a live-line tool). 
The Bay-O-Net fuse is found in the transformer’s 
high voltage compartment, which is above the 
transformer’s primary bushings. The Bay-O-Net 
fuse is specifically rated to make and break the 
connections to a transformer supplying load-
level currents and is, therefore, used to turn on 
or turn off the transformer under safe operating 
conditions. Because of its nature as a manually 
operated fuse, the operator’s skills are essential 
in ensuring reliable operation; who must verify 
the latching of the fuse before re-energizing. The 
Bay-O-Net fuse typically comes in two distinct 
packages; The fuse can be either a partial range 
current-limiting type or an expulsion type. 
Figure. The two types of Bay-O-Net Fuses: (a) A 
Current Limiting Partial-Range Type Model and 
Holder. (b) The Expulsion Type Model and Holder 
image, with the external Isolation Link. 
Important! 
WARNING: 
Note:
Fuses have particular conditions and ratings and 
should always be operated within them. When a fuse is 
to be replaced, the replacement fuse must have similar 
characteristics. E.g., their voltage and time-current 
characteristics must be the same. There are generally 
two considerations to selecting the fuse ampere rating.
The first consideration in determining the fuse’s 
ampere rating is to test the fuse’s ability to withstand 
inrush currents without taking damage. For example, 
the fuse must be able to withstand the large transient 
current that momentarily passes through a transformer 
when it is initially energized. This current flows 
through the transformer due to the connected load, 
which draws current through the transformer, the 
transformer’s magnetic circuit, or even due to the 
system configuration. Therefore, this current is also 
called the magnetizing inrush current or the cold load 
pickup current, and it is important in observing a fuse’s 
withstand capability.
The second consideration in determining the fuse’s 
ampere rating is verifying whether it can successfully 
carry the maximum normal load current without 
operating or damaging it. The fuse manufacturer 
normally provides a fusing table for their product, 
and these tables can help determine the range 
of tolerable overload currents. The exact value of 
permitted overload can be found by comparing the 
longtime minimum melt current of a particular fuse 
to the transformer’s rated current. The application 
table of the fuse is usually obtained from tests 
conducted under the ambient temperature of 25°C to 
40°C. The permitted overload is inversely proportional 
to temperature, and when fuses are used in high-
temperature applications, the operators should apply 
extra care to how the fuse is used. General-purpose 
CL fuses can be accommodated for the overload and 
derating factors by following the ratio:
Finally, it is vital to verify the fuse’s capability to 
isolate the transformer when a current beyond 
its current rating flows through it, without the 
transformer suffering any thermal damage. To 
do so, an observer must take the observed total 
clearing characteristics of the fuse and compare 
them with the standard provisions found in the 
IEEE damage line (I2t).
A fuse should never be removed with 
pressure on the tank. The dielectric 
fluid has high temperatures and may 
cause severe burns and injuries.
The damage line indicates the tolerance of a 
device when faced with possible faults. When the 
total clearing characteristics of the fuse lie to the 
left of the damage line for all expected values of 
fault current, it indicates that no damage is done 
to the device. However, most fuse characteristics 
do cross the damage line, and thus, it is crucial to 
isolate the device at the lowest possible value of 
the fault current.
All protective devices have an Interrupting Rating, 
which is a measure of the device’s maximum 
symmetrical fault current tolerance. This rating 
indicates the highest value fault condition, e.g., 
the maximum value of current, that the protection 
device can clear without excessive damage to 
itself, its characteristics, or the device under its 
protection. It is crucial for the interrupting rating 
of a protective device to be greater than the 
maximum available symmetrical fault current 
that it might have to clear during its life. This 
maximum fault current results from the electrical 
system configuration, for example, the voltage 
and current flow it usually operates with. Hence, 
the interrupting rating must be greater than the 
maximum fault current that a particular system 
can feed in case of faults.
All fuses are designed with specific criteria in mind. 
They must, therefore, be operated within specific 
ratings. They should have time-current characteristics 
and equivalent voltage, per the Manufacturer’s provided 
tabulations.
High temperatures have minimum effects on the 
operation of expulsion and backup CL fuses and thus 
do not suffer the derating factors.

Bay-O-Net Fuse Electrical 
Ratings 
Partial Range Current Limiting 
(PRCL) Fuses 
The Partial Range Current Limiting Type Bay-O-Net fuse 
is designed to clear high current (low impedance) faults. 
Under proper operations, this fuse must only operate for 
internal faults - faults within the transformer. A PRCL fuse 
has several key characteristics:
It is an Oil immersed fuse and has an internally block-
mounted design.
Its principal function is to provide protection against 
tank rupture – an undesirable consequence of high 
current faults.
A PRCL fuse is used in a series configuration with 
the Expulsion type fuse, which itself is a low-current 
primary protection device.
The PRCL fuse is used in transformers to protect and 
isolate faulty equipment, and the current limiting section 
of the fuse is highly efficient in protecting the distribution 
system from high fault current stresses. The minimum 
interrupting rating of the fuse is set in such a way to avoid 
any undesirable low current operations for which sufficient 
protection must be provided through additional low current 
interrupters while still executing the isolation of the 
transformer in case of the higher fault currents because of 
its maximum interrupting rating. The continuous current 
ratings of the protective setup can even be increased, if 
needed, by combining two fuses in parallel to one another. 
The PRCL fuse is seldom used alone, however, as 
it is usually connected to a low current interrupting 
device like the replaceable expulsion type fuse 
to increase the range of protection, i.e., it gives 
protection from high fault currents and low fault 
currents. And while this may not be as economical 
as many assemblies, such a two-part protection 
scheme is usually very reliable and secured. As an 
additional benefit, the two-part assembly can easily 
be coordinated with any upstream or downstream 
protection devices, whether they offer low current 
or high current protection.
Expulsion Type (ET) Fuse
The Expulsion Type Bay-O-Net fuse is designed to 
clear any low current (high impedance) faults and 
overload conditions. An ET fuse has the following 
key characteristics: 
It is an Oil immersed fuse, and it has a load-
break design.
A Hookstick is needed to operate the ET fuse
The fuse can be replaced by drawing out the 
defective fuse. 
The ET fuse is available with fault sensing or 
a load-sensing dual element to facilitate its 
operation.
The Bay-O-Net fuses are primarily used for 
transformer protection and distribution system 
protection. Their design is well suited to protect 
pad-mounted transformers and fluid-filled, sub-
surface distribution transformers. The two key 
features of the Bay-O-Net fuse design are its ease 
of use because its hot-stick operation is facilitated 
throughout its design and the added security 
from its dead-front design, which means that its 
outer shell never becomes energized due to the 
properties of the material used for its construction. 
The electrical isolation of an apparatus can be 
presumed after removing the fuse holder from the 
assembly. At this moment, the fuse element can 
easily be inspected, and, if needed, it can just as 
easily be replaced.
A typical sidewall-mounted Bay-O-Net assembly 
called the Flapper™ fuse houses a flapper valve to 
help prevent oil leakage by closing automatically 
whenever the fuse holder is removed.
