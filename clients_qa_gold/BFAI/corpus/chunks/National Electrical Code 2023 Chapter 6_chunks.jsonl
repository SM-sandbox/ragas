(A) Motor and Branch-Circuit Overload Protection. Each\nmotor, motor controller, and branch-circuit conductor shall be\nprotected from overload by one of the following means:\n (1) A single motor shall be considered as protected where\nthe branch-circuit overcurrent device meets the rating\nrequirements of 610.42. (2) Overload relay elements in each ungrounded circuit\nconductor, with all relay elements protected from short\ncircuit by the branch-circuit protection. (3) Thermal sensing devices, sensitive to motor temperature\nor to temperature and current, that are thermally in\ncontact with the motor winding(s). Hoist functions shall\nbe considered to be protected if the sensing device limits\nthe hoist to lowering only during an overload condition. Traverse functions shall be considered to be protected if\nthe sensing device limits the travel in both directions for\nthe affected function during an overload condition of\neither motor. (B) Manually Controlled Motor. If the motor is manually\ncontrolled, with spring return controls, the overload protective\ndevice shall not be required to protect the motor against stalled\nrotor conditions. (C) Multimotor. Where two or more motors drive a single trol-\nley, truck, or bridge and are controlled as a unit and protected\nby a single set of overload devices with a rating equal to the\nsum of their rated full-load currents, a hoist or trolley shall be\nconsidered to be protected if the sensing device is connected in\nthe hoist's upper limit switch circuit so as to prevent further\nhoisting during an overtemperature condition of either motor.

Informational Note: Some elevator motor currents, or those\nmotor currents of similar function, exceed the motor nameplate\nvalue. Heating of the motor and conductors is dependent on\nthe root-mean square (rms) current value and the length of\noperation time.
