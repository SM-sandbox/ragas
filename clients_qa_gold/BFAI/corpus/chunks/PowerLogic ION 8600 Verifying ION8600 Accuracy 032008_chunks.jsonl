It is\ntested for accuracy at the factory and remains accurate for the life of the meter. In\ncontrast, electro\u2010mechanical meters need mechanical adjustment before\ninstallation and periodic calibration thereafter. This procedure is unnecessary for\ndigital meters.\nDigital meters require \u2018accuracy\u2019 testing, or verification to ensure the meter meets\nrequired accuracy specification. If you know your meter is within required\naccuracy specification before installation, errors observed in the field could be\nattributed to incorrect connections or instrument transformer ratio settings.\nAccuracy Standards and Current Ranges\nThe meter conforms to the following accuracy standards, depending on what\ncurrent option is ordered:\nStandard Accuracy Range Starting Current\nOrder Option\nIEC 62053-22 5A 0.2S (formerly\nC 50 mA to 20 A 5 mA\nIEC 60687 5A 0.2S)\nANSI C12.20 current class 20\nC 150 mA to 20 A 5 mA\naccuracy class 0.2\nIEC 62053-22 1A 0.2S (formerly\nIEC 60687 1A 0.2S)\nE 1 mA\nIEC 62053-22 5A 0.2S (formerly\nIEC 60687 5A 0.2S)\nANSI C12.20 current class 2 and\nE 15 mA to 10 A 1 mA\n10 accuracy class 0.2\nDANGER\nDuring operation, hazardous voltages are present on the terminals of the meter and throughout the\nconnected test equipment and control power circuits.\n\u2022 Only qualified, properly trained personnel should perform meter verification testing.\n\u2022 Connect meter safety ground terminal to a low impedance safety ground system in all\ntest configurations.\nFailure to follow these instructions will result in severe injury or death.\nTesting Overview\nThe most common method for testing meters is to inject voltage and current from\na stable power source and compare the meter energy readings with readings from\na reference energy meter or energy standard. In general, it is recommended that a\nmeter\u02b9s accuracy be verified using a reference meter or an energy standard, rather\nthan only the source of the test signal.

Ensure\nthat the test socket for the meter or the mounting device is properly connected to\nthe source of the test signal and the reference meter or standard.\nThe current and voltage transformers must be accurately rated and must perform\nwithin specifications to provide accurate results. Usually voltage or current\ntransformers are not used in ION8600 meter verification testing.\nPower source\nIt is important to have a steady power source. Power that energizes the meter from\nthe socket must be reliable and provide: the rated voltage of the meter, unity power\nfactor (1.0) and lagging power factor of 0.0 (for VARh testing) or 0.5.\nThe ION8600 meter will maintain its accuracy during signal source variations, but\nits energy pulsing output needs a stable test signal to produce accurate test pulses.\nThe meter energy pulsing mechanism needs approximately three to four seconds\nto stabilize after every source adjustment; the meter measurements are accurate\nduring the signal source transitions, but the pulse output should be allowed to\nstabilize before the start of every test to ensure accuracy.\nNOTE\nIn order to conduct verification testing of ION8600 meters powered from the voltage inputs, the source\nof the test signal should be capable of supplying sufficient power to the meter under test. With three\nphases present, typical per phase power consumption of the meter is: 5 VA/3.5 W at 120 V, 7 VA/4 W\nat 277 V. Please refer to the ION8600 technical specifications for more details.\nTest loads\nThere are three possible methods of current loading: in\u2010situ load (a meter in\nservice), resistance load (characteristics similar to a lighting load), and phantom\nloading (a test board). Your test load device or other loading circuit must be set\nwithin the current capacity ranges for the meter. The procedure outlined in this\ntechnical note describes verification using a phantom load or test board.\nControl equipment\nControl equipment is required for counting and timing the pulse outputs\n(revolutions) from the front panel LEDs. Most standard test benches have an arm\nwith optical sensors used for this purpose. Make sure the optical sensor can pick\nup red LED or infrared signals.\nNOTE\nThe optical sensors on the test bench can be disrupted by strong sources of ambient light (such as camera\nflashes, fluorescent tubes, sunlight reflections, floodlights, etc.) and cause test errors."}

The ideal reference ambient temperature is typically 23oC (73oF).\nEnsure the meter is warmed up sufficiently before testing.\nA warm up time of 30 minutes is recommended for ION8600 meters before energy\naccuracy verification testing. At the factory, the meters are warmed up to their\ntypical operating temperature before calibration. This pre\u2010calibration warm up\nensures that ION8600 meters will reach their optimal accuracy at operating\ntemperature.\nMost high precision electronic equipment requires a warm up time before it\nreaches its specified performance levels.

During the warm-up time, the meter may be powered from any source (e.g. mains).\nThe following are guidelines for testing the meter. Your meter shop may have\nspecific testing methods:\n1. Place the meter into the test socket or other standard measuring device. For\nsingle\u2010phase testing, ensure all voltages are in parallel with the meter being\ntested, all currents are in series, and the neutral voltage terminal of the meter\nis grounded.\n2. Connect the control equipment used for switching the voltage to the test\nstandard device.\n3. Connect the control equipment used for counting the standard output pulses.\n4. Apply the nominal current and voltage to the terminals of the meter.\n5. Before performing the verification test, let the test equipment power up the\nmeter; apply voltage for at least 30 seconds. The warm\u2010up allows the internal\ncircuitry to stabilize.\n6. You may choose to place the meter in TEST mode. This allows the meter to enter\nthe field with no Wh values in the registers. If you are performing field testing,\nput the meter in TEST mode to avoid incorrect customer billing.\n7. Align the optical sensor on the standard test bench armature over the\nappropriate front panel LED pulser.\nTIP\nIf the outer cover is still on the meter, align the meter sensor slightly off-perpendicular to the LEDs. This\nreduces reflections from the outer cover.\nAlso be aware that any flashing lights in the test area may reflect and register as pulses, affecting testing\nresults.\n8. Perform testing on all test points listed in the tables \u201cWatt\u2010hour test points \u2010\nExample\u201d and \u201cVAR\u2010hour points \u2010 Example\u201d on page12.\n9. Run each test point for at least 30 seconds to allow the test bench equipment\nto read an adequate number of pulses. Allow 10 seconds of dwell time\nbetween test points. The number of pulses required for a test duration of \u201ct\u201d\nseconds can be determined using the following formula:\nNumber_of_pulses = [Ne * V * I * |PF | * t] / [3600 * kT]\nWhere:\nNe = number of metering elements used\nV = test point voltage in volts [V] per phase\nI = test point current in amps [A] per phase\nPage 8 \u00a9 2008 Schneider Electric.
