Flexible cords and flexible cables shall conform\nto the description in Table 400.4. The use of flexible cords and\nflexible cables other than those in Table 400.4 shall require\npermission by the authority having jurisdiction. 400.5 Ampacities for Flexible Cords and Flexible Cables. (A) Ampacity Tables. Table 400.5(A) (1) provides the ampaci-\nties for flexible cords and flexible cables, and Table 400.5(A)\n(2) provides the ampacities for flexible cords and flexible\ncables with not more than three current-carrying conductors. These tables shall be used in conjunction with applicable end-\nuse product standards to ensure selection of the proper size\nand type. Where cords and cables are used in ambient tempera-\ntures other than 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F), the temperature correction\nfactors from Table 310.15(B) (1) (1) that correspond to the\ntemperature rating of the cord or cable shall be applied to the\nampacity in Table 400.5(A) (1) and Table 400.5(A) (2). Cords\nand cables rated 105\u00b0C shall use correction factors in the 90\u00b0C\ncolumn of Table 310.15(B) (1) (1) for temperature correction. Where the number of current-carrying conductors exceeds\nthree, the ampacity of each conductor shall be reduced from\nthe three-conductor rating as shown in Table 400.5 (A) (3). Informational Note: See Informative Annex B, Table B.2(11),\nfor adjustment factors for more than three current-carrying\nconductors in a raceway or cable with load diversity. A neutral conductor that carries only the unbalanced\ncurrent from other conductors of the same circuit shall not be\nrequired to meet the requirements of a current-carrying\nconductor. In a 3-wire circuit consisting of two phase conductors and\nthe neutral conductor of a 4-wire, 3-phase, wye-connected\nsystem, a common conductor carries approximately the same\ncurrent as the line-to-neutral currents of the other conductors\nand shall be considered to be a current-carrying conductor. On a 4-wire, 3-phase, wye circuit where more than\n50 percent of the load consists of nonlinear loads, there are\nharmonic currents present in the neutral conductor and the\nneutral conductor shall be considered to be a current-carrying\nconductor. An equipment grounding conductor shall not be considered\na current-carrying conductor."}

Exposed accessible terminals in lampholders and\nswitches shall not be installed in metal luminaire canopies or in\nopen bases of portable table or floor luminaires. Exception: Cleat-type lampholders located at least 2.5 m (8 ft) above the\nfloor shall be permitted to have exposed terminals. 410.6 Listing Required. All luminaires, lampholders, and\nretrofit kits shall be listed. 410.8 Inspection. Luminaires shall be installed such that the\nconnections between the luminaire conductors and the circuit\nconductors can be inspected without requiring the disconnec-\ntion of any part of the wiring unless the luminaires are connec-\nted by attachment plugs and receptacles. Part II. Luminaire Locations\n 410.10 Luminaires in Specific Locations. (A) Wet and Damp Locations. Luminaires installed in wet or\ndamp locations shall be installed such that water cannot enter\nor accumulate in wiring compartments, lampholders, or other\nelectrical parts. All luminaires installed in wet locations shall be\nmarked as suitable for wet locations. All luminaires installed in\ndamp locations shall be marked as suitable for wet locations or\nsuitable for damp locations. (B) Corrosive Locations. Luminaires installed in corrosive\nlocations shall be of a type suitable for such locations. NATIONAL ELECTRICAL CODE 2023 Edition\n Copyright NFPA. For exclusive use on NFPA Free Access platform.
