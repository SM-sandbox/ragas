This may be possible through a shrewd and rational consumption\nof well-known resources, and also by looking for new forms of clean and not\nexhaustible energy.\nRegenerating sources of energy are fundamental to solve this problem. Under these\ncircumstances, solar energy exploitation to generate electrical (photovoltaic) energy is\nbecoming more and more important worldwide.\nPhotovoltaic energy, in any case, is of great advantage to the environment because the\nradiated energy we receive from the sun is transformed directly into electrical energy\nwithout any combustion process and without producing any pollution."}

In order to utilize this energy and feed it back to the distribution grid, this\nenergy shall be turned into alternating (AC) current. Aurora does this conversion, also\nknown as DC to AC inversion, in a very efficient way, without using rotating parts but\njust static power electronic devices.\nWhen used in parallel with the grid, the alternate current generated by the inverter is\ndirectly fed to the domestic distribution circuit, which is in its turn also connected to\nthe public power distribution grid.\nThe solar energy system can thus feed all the connected users, such as lighting\ndevices, household appliances, etc.\nWhen the photovoltaic system is not generating sufficient energy, the power required\nto ensure proper operation of connected users is taken from the public power grid.\nWhile if the produced energy is too much, it is directly fed to the grid, thus becoming\navailable to other users.\nAccording to national and local standards and regulations the produced energy can be\nsold to the grid or credited to the user against future consumption, thus granting a great\nsaving of money.\n2.1 Key elements of a photovoltaic system: \u201cSTRINGS\u201d and \u201cARRAYS\u201d\nThe so-called STRINGS technology has been developed in order to reduce the\ninstallation costs of a photovoltaic system as much as possible. These costs are mainly\nrelated to the wiring operations on inverter DC side and the consequent distribution on\nthe AC side.\nA photovoltaic panel is composed of many photovoltaic cells assembled on the same\nmount. A STRING is composed of a certain number of panels electrically connected in\nseries. An ARRAY is composed by one or more strings connected in parallel.\nLarger photovoltaic systems may be implemented by using several arrays connected to\none or more AURORA inverters."}

Each array is\ncontrolled by an MPPT control circuit.\nThanks to its high efficiency and generously sized heat sink, the AURORA inverter\nprovides maximum power operation in a broad range of ambient temperatures.\nThe inverter is controlled by two independent DSPs (Digital Signal Processors) and\none central microprocessor.\nThis way, grid connection is controlled by two independent computers in full\ncompliance with electrical power supply and safety regulations.\nAurora operative system communicates with the related parts to proceed to data\nprocessing.\nThis process ensures optimal performance levels of the whole units, as well as a high\nefficiency under all solar radiation and load conditions, always in full compliance with\nthe applicable directives, standards and regulations."}

To avoid any \npossible islanding operation, Aurora is provided with an automatic disconnection \nprotective system called Anti-Islanding. \nThe AURORA PVI-5000/6000-OUTD-US model is equipped with a state-of-the-art \nanti-islanding protection system certified to the following standards and regulations: \n\u00be CSA-C22.2 N.107.1-01 UL Std N.1741 \n2.4.2 \nPanel Ground Fault \nThis version of AURORA has been designed for use with panels with a floating \nconnection (positive and negative terminals not connected to ground). A sophisticated \nground protection circuit continually monitors the ground connection; when it detects \na ground fault, this circuit shuts down AURORA and turns on a red LED on the front \npanel to indicate a ground fault condition. The AURORA inverter is equipped with a \nterminal for the system grounding conductor; see section 3.6 (step 3) for more details. \nNOTE: For more details of AURORA shutdown or possible causes of \nmalfunction, please refer to sections 5.3 and 5.4.\n\n2.4.3 \nFurther Protective Devices \nAurora is equipped with additional protections to guarantee safe operation under any \ncircumstances. The protections include: \n\u00be \nconstant monitoring of grid voltage to ensure that voltage and frequency remain \nwithin the specified operational limits (in accordance with UL 1741 standard); \n\u00be \nautomatic power limitation control based on internal temperature monitoring to \navoid overheating (heat sink temperature \u226470\u00b0C [158\u00b0F]).\n\nMany control devices are fitted to Aurora, making its structure redundant, but at \nthe same time ensuring a perfect and fully safe operation."}

Maximum number of\ninverters that can be connected in daisy chain is 248. Recommended maximum length of this\nchain is 1200 metres.\nIn case many inverters are connected in a daisy chain, it is necessary to assign an address to\neach unit. Refer to paragraph 5.5.6.1 for instructions on how to set addresses.\nMoreover, the last inverter of the chain must have line termination contact active (S2 switch -\n120\u2126 TERM set to ON). See fig. 24.\nAny AURORA device is supplied with default address two (2) and with the S1 dip switch in\nthe OFF position.\nIn order to ensure optimum communication on RS485 line, Power-One recommends to\nconnect PVI-RS232485 adapter in-between the first unit of the daisy chain and the computer.\nSee fig. 25 for further details.\nTo this purpose other equivalent devices available on the market can also be used but Power-\nOne does not assure correct connection operation since equipment has never been tested with\nthese equivalent devices.\nPlease note that these commercial devices could require an external termination impedance,\nwhich is not necessary for Aurora PVI-232485.\nThe following diagram shows you how to connect many multiple units in daisy chain\nconfiguration."}
