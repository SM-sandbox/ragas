          "ground_truth": "Based on the BDM-2000-T datasheet, the recommended maximum PV power is 750W x 4, totaling 3000W. While the BDM-2000-T datasheet doesn't directly address panel upgrades, the NEP BDM-550 & BDM-650 whitepaper indicates that 100A service panels often require upgrades due to limited capacity and the 120% rule for solar back-feed. The BDM-550 and BDM-650 microinverters are designed to avoid panel upgrades by optimizing AC output current to stay within the 120% back-feed rule for 100A panels and allowing more units per circuit.",
          "rag_answer": "Based on the provided context:\n\n**Regarding the BDM-2000-T microinverter with four 700W PV modules and a 100A service panel:**\n\nThe context states that for a 100A panel, the 120% Rule allows only 20A of allowable back-feed [1]. The BDM-2000-T microinverter has a Max Continuous Output Power of 1920 W and a Rated Output Current of 8.0A (for 240 Vac) [7]. While a single BDM-2000-T unit's output current (8.0A) is well within the 20A back-feed limit, the context does not specify how many BDM-2000-T microinverters constitute \"a system\" in this scenario, nor does it provide information on the total allowable back-feed current for multiple BDM-2000-T units on a 100A panel. Therefore, the context does not contain enough information to definitively state whether a system using the BDM-2000-T microinverter would likely require a 100A service panel upgrade.\n\n**How the BDM-550/650 models address this potential issue according to NEP:**\n\nNEP states that the BDM-550 and BDM-650 microinverters are optimized for homes with 100A panels to avoid costly electrical upgrades [2]. They address this issue by:\n*   **Avoiding panel upgrades:** By optimizing the AC output current, these models help stay within the 120% rule for back-feed on 100A panels [1].\n*   **Low current draw:** The BDM-550 has a rated output current of ~2.3A, and the BDM-650 has ~2.7A [2, 3]. This lower current draw per unit reduces back-feed stress on limited panel capacity [3].\n*   **Cost-effective scaling:** Installers can deploy more units per circuit (e.g., 7 units of BDM-550 or 6 units of BDM-650 per 20A branch) [2, 3], maximizing system size without triggering main panel upgrades and staying compliant with NEC back-feed limits [1, 2].",

          "ground_truth": "The Southern States Group Operated Switch Application Guide identifies double end break center break switches as a type of group operated switch. The EPEC_1200-6000A UL 891 SWBD (Industrial) Flyer describes a 600VAC, 6000A switchboard that can be configured as single ended or double ended (M-M or M-T-M). Therefore, a double end break center break switch *could* potentially be used as a main component. The flyer specifies an interrupting rating of 65kAIC at 600VAC, which would need to be considered when selecting the appropriate group operated switch to ensure it meets or exceeds the required interrupting rating for the application.",

It does not explicitly mention a single switch type that is both \"double-ended\" and \"center break.\"\n\n2.  **Use as a main component in a 600VAC, 6000A UL 891 certified switchboard:**\n    *   UL 891 certified switchboards are available for 600VAC and up to 6000A (Context [8]).\n    *   However, the context for UL 891 switchboards specifies \"Main breaker ranges: 1200A \u2013 5000A (6000A air cooled), MLO up to 6000A\" (Context [8]). It also mentions \"Feeder ranges ACB\" (Air Circuit Breaker) and \"MCCB\" (Molded Case Circuit Breaker) as components.\n    *   Group operated switches are generally disconnect switches used for isolation, not typically as the main protective device (main breaker) responsible for interrupting fault currents in a switchboard. The context does not indicate that a group operated switch would serve as a \"main breaker\" or \"main component\" in the sense of fault interruption for a UL 891 switchboard.\n    *   The Southern States Group Operated Switch Application Guide (Context [5], [12]) lists switches up to 5000A, with a note to \"contact factory\" for continuous current ratings above 5000A.\n\n3.  **Interrupting ratings considerations:**\n    *   UL 891 certified switchboards have specified interrupt ratings, such as \"65kAIC @ 600VAC\" (Context [8]).\n    *   Group operated switches, like the EV-2, have \"Short-Time Symmetrical Withstand (3 Sec)\" ratings (e.g., 63 kA RMS) and \"Peak Withstand\" ratings (e.g., 164 kA) (Context [7]). These are *withstand* ratings, meaning the switch can safely carry the fault current for a short duration until an upstream protective device clears the fault. They are not *interrupting* ratings, as group operated switches are not designed to interrupt fault currents.\n    *   The actual interruption of fault currents in a UL 891 switchboard would be handled by circuit breakers (e.g., Siemens MCCBs with interrupting ratings like 35 kA or 50 kA at 600V, depending on the type, as seen in Context [6] and [9]), which must meet or exceed the switchboard's overall interrupting rating.\n\nIn summary, based *only* on the provided context, it is not indicated that a \"double-ended center break group operated switch\" (a configuration not explicitly listed as a single type) would be used as a main *protective* component in a 600VAC, 6000A UL 891 certified switchboard. While the switchboard itself can handle these ratings, group operated switches are typically for isolation and have withstand ratings, not interrupting ratings. The interrupting function would be performed by circuit breakers within the switchboard.",

A low power factor indicates inefficient use of electrical power.\n*   **Watts, VAR, VA, and Energy (Watt-Hr, VAR-Hr, VA-Hr):** The meter provides real-time, average, maximum, and minimum readings for Watts, VAR (reactive power), and VA (apparent power), as well as cumulative energy readings (+Watt-Hr, -Watt-Hr, Watt-Hr Net, +VAR-Hr, -VAR-Hr, VAR-Hr Net, VA-Hr) (Context [11]). These measurements directly quantify energy consumption and reactive power, which are key indicators of overall energy usage and efficiency.\n\n**For Potential Overheating (indirectly through electrical parameters):**\n*   **Current Per Phase:** The Shark 100T measures Current Per Phase in real-time, average, maximum, and minimum values (Context [11]). Excessive current draw can lead to increased heat generation within the enclosure.\n*   **Total Harmonic Distortion (%THD):** The meter measures %THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) for voltage and current in real-time, average, maximum, and minimum values (Context [11]). High THD, particularly in current, can cause additional heating in electrical components and wiring.\n*   **Voltage (L-N, L-L) and Max/Min Readings:** The meter provides real-time, average, maximum, and minimum readings for Voltage L-N and Voltage L-L (Context [11]). It also displays instantaneous Max and Min voltage readings for highest surge and lowest sag (Context [4]). While not a direct temperature measurement, significant voltage sags or surges can impact equipment performance and potentially lead to conditions that increase current draw or stress components, indirectly contributing to heat.\n\nThe Shark 100T can communicate these measured values via its RS-485 port using protocols such as Modbus RTU, Modbus ASCII, or DNP 3.0 (Context [2]). This allows for remote monitoring and analysis of these power quality parameters.",

Therefore, the maintenance procedure for the inverter in this configuration would be found in the PVI Central 250-300 manual.",
          "rag_answer": "To maintain a PVI Central 250-300 inverter when it is part of a 4.2MVA power block utilizing a main switchboard with MCCBs, the safety manual mandates a \"MANDATORY UPSTREAM DISCONNECTION\" before performing any internal maintenance or operating on exposed parts [5, 8].\n\n**Disconnection Procedure:**\n1.  **Disconnect from AC and DC sides:** It is absolutely mandatory to disconnect the inverter from both the DC (photovoltaic field) and AC (grid/distribution line) sides. This operation must be performed using the switches on the photovoltaic field and on the distribution line (which would include the main switchboard with MCCBs), and *not* the switches on board the inverter, because the input cables are always under voltage otherwise [5, 7, 8].\n2.  **AC Grid Disconnection:**\n    *   Set all Master modules of the rack to the REMOTE OFF position via the display. This ensures power fed into the grid is practically null [8].\n    *   Turn the AC switch to the 0 position (counter-clockwise) [8].\n3.  **Wait Time:** After disconnecting all sources of DC and AC, wait at least 5 minutes to ensure hazardous high voltage and energy inside the equipment has discharged before opening the equipment or removing panels [2, 10].\n\n**Routine Maintenance Procedures (recommended every six months, or more frequently based on environmental conditions) [3]:**\n1.  **Filter Cleaning (Upper Input Air Filters):**\n    *   Remove the panel at the top of the inverter by unscrewing the two locking screws and pulling the panel towards yourself [9].\n    *   Remove the filter fitted inside and wash it (do not use solvents!). Also, check the input grills for obstruction [9].\n    *   Ensure the filter is perfectly dry before replacing it [9].\n2.  **Visual and Screw Inspections:**\n    *   Once the system has been disconnected and inverter panels removed, open the inverter to check screws and perform a general visual inspection [5].\n3.  **ACBOX Area Checks (requires removing the front panel):**\n    *   **GFD Fuse Check:** If a GFD device signals a ground fault, open the fuse compartment, remove the tripped fuse, and replace it with an equivalent fuse [10].\n    *   **Fan Control:** Note the current position of the thermostat (normally set at approximately 40\u00b0C). Turn the knob of the thermostat temperature completely counter-clockwise (the QS2 switch must be ON). In this position, the fans will activate. Make sure all are moving regularly and do not produce unusual noises. Turn the thermostat back to the value noted previously [10].\n\n**General Safety:**\n*   Since most interventions require the removal of security panels, it is vital to ensure all panels, especially the front panels of the fuses and their relative earth connections, have been correctly replaced before switching the inverter on again [11].",

It provides the procedure itself, but not the meta-information about where it's documented.\n\n**Faithfulness (1/5):** This is a critical failure. The RAG answer cites multiple sources ([2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]), but the *only* retrieved context provided is [1] 'CPS 125kW Manual'. The content of the RAG answer (specific steps for PVI Central 250-300, 'MANDATORY UPSTREAM DISCONNECTION', filter cleaning, GFD fuse check, fan control, etc.) is entirely absent from the provided context. This indicates that the RAG system either hallucinated the information or used unprovided context, making it unfaithful to the given retrieval.\n\n**Relevance (5/5):** The RAG answer is highly relevant to the question. The question asks for the recommended procedure, and the RAG answer provides a detailed procedure.\n\n**Clarity (5/5):** The RAG answer is exceptionally well-written, clearly structured with headings and bullet points, and easy to understand.\n\n**Overall Verdict:** Despite high scores for relevance and clarity, the fundamental failures in correctness (relative to the ground truth's content), completeness (missing the ground truth's key point), and especially faithfulness (not grounded in the provided context) lead to a 'fail' verdict. A RAG system that hallucinates its answer or uses unprovided context, even if the answer is relevant and clear, is fundamentally broken."
