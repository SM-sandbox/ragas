The inverter safety instructions repeatedly emphasize the need to \"Turn OFF the AC feed breaker\" as a critical safety step before maintenance or during fault conditions (Context [5]).

          "ground_truth": "Based on the BDM-2000-T datasheet, the recommended maximum PV power is 750W x 4, totaling 3000W. While the BDM-2000-T datasheet doesn't directly address panel upgrades, the NEP BDM-550 & BDM-650 whitepaper indicates that 100A service panels often require upgrades due to limited capacity and the 120% rule for solar back-feed. The BDM-550 and BDM-650 microinverters are designed to avoid panel upgrades by optimizing AC output current to stay within the 120% back-feed rule for 100A panels and allowing more units per circuit.",
          "rag_answer": "A system using a single BDM-2000-T microinverter with four 700W PV modules has a Rated Output Current of 8.0A (Context [4]). According to the NEC 120% rule, a 100A panel allows for 20A of allowable back-feed (Context [2]). Since 8.0A is less than 20A, the output current of this single BDM-2000-T microinverter would not, by itself, exceed the allowable back-feed limit for a 100A panel. However, the context also states that a 100A panel may not support the additional load from solar back-feed if the home already has high electrical demand (Context [2]), and this information is not provided. Therefore, based solely on the microinverter's output current, it would not exceed the back-feed limit, but other factors not detailed in the context could still necessitate an upgrade.\n\nAccording to NEP, the BDM-550 and BDM-650 models address the potential issue of 100A panel upgrades by:\n*   **Optimizing AC output current:** Their low current draw (~2.3A for BDM-550, ~2.7A for BDM-650) reduces back-feed stress on limited panel capacity and helps stay within the 120% rule for back-feed on 100A panels (Context [1], [2], [3]).\n*   **Enabling more units per branch circuit:** Their low current draw allows for efficient string sizing, permitting more units per 20A branch circuit (7 units for BDM-550, 6 units for BDM-650) without overloading circuits (Context [1], [3]). This allows installers to deploy more units per circuit, maximizing system size without triggering main panel upgrades (Context [2]).\n*   **Dual MPPT Inputs:** These microinverters support two panels per inverter, leading to fewer AC connections and a lower panel load (Context [1], [3]).\n*   **Avoiding costly upgrades:** They are designed to deliver high-efficiency solar without triggering costly electrical upgrades, offering a cost-effective solution that helps avoid additional expenses and delayed completion timelines associated with panel upgrades (Context [1], [2]).",

The VFI breaker initiates operation based on parameters of any of the three phases and performs a mechanical gang trip, isolating the transformer from all three phases if a fault or overload condition is sensed.

The ground truth states the maximum allowable solar back-feed is 1200A (120% of 1000A), which is a misinterpretation of the rule. The 120% rule typically refers to the sum of the main breaker and the PV breaker not exceeding 120% of the busbar rating. The RAG answer correctly applies the formula derived from the context's example for a 100A panel: (Panel Rating * 1.2) - Panel Rating, resulting in 200A for a 1000A panel, which is the correct maximum backfeed breaker size. This means 30A of backfeed would be well within the limit, implicitly suggesting no upgrade is needed based on this rule, which contradicts the ground truth's conclusion but is based on a more accurate calculation.

To completely insulate the inverter from the rest of the plant, this operation is only possible by using the switches on the photovoltaic field and on the distribution line, and not the switches on board the inverter [3].\n\nThe recommended procedure involves the following steps:\n\n1.  **Disconnection from the AC grid:**\n    *   Set all Master modules of the rack to the REMOTE OFF position by means of the display. This ensures the power fed into the grid is practically null, allowing the AC switch to be opened in the absence of any load [4].\n    *   Turn the AC switch to the 0 (OFF) position (counter-clockwise) [4].\n\n2.  **Disconnecting the photovoltaic field (DC):**\n    *   Make sure that the AC switch is in the 0 (OFF) position [2].\n    *   Open the door [2].\n    *   One at a time, turn the DC switches to the 0 (OFF) position (counter-clockwise) [2].\n\n3.  **Wait for heat dissipation:**\n    *   Before proceeding to the next step, wait 30 minutes to ensure there is a proper heat dissipation through the system fans [2].\n\n4.  **Disconnection from the auxiliary line:**\n    *   Act on the possible main switch located upstream (by the installer) or set the internal QS2 switch to OFF to disconnect the auxiliary supply [2].\n\nAt this point, the system is completely disconnected and switched off [2].\n\nThe context does not explicitly mention a \"4.2MVA power block\" or \"MCCBs\" but emphasizes the need for upstream disconnection from the plant's distribution lines and photovoltaic field [2, 3, 4].",

While it correctly quotes the meter's general capabilities for power monitoring, it lacks the specific compatibility information (e.g., voltage rating, EPEC compatibility) that the Ground Truth correctly identifies as missing. The RAG does qualify that 'The context does not specify a maximum MVA rating', which is a good observation, but the initial 'Yes' is too strong.\n*   For the second part (communication protocols), the RAG correctly identifies DNP 3.0 (from Context [1]) and RS-485P (from Context [2]). However, it incorrectly lists 'RS-485 Modbus' (Modbus is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context) and 'IrDA Port' (not mentioned in context).
