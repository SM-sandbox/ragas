It supports up to (15) 275kW inverters for a 4.2MVA power block. Since the PVI-CENTRAL-250-US is a 250kW inverter, more than 15 units would be required to reach 4.2MVA. The document does not specify the maximum number of 250kW inverters that can be connected in this configuration.\n    2.  **Main Switchboard (AC Recombiner) / Field AC Combiner:** This configuration uses a modular switchboard with ACBs fed by field-mounted AC combiners. Each AC combiner can handle up to (4) 275kW inverters for a 4.2MVA power block. Since the PVI-CENTRAL-250-US is a 250kW inverter, more than 4 units per AC combiner would be required to reach 4.2MVA. The document does not specify the maximum number of 250kW inverters that can be connected in this configuration.\n    3.  **Main Switchboard / Field Inverter Cluster with PICS 1000A:** This configuration uses a \"main breaker only\" switchboard and EPEC PICS 1000A fusible disconnects to combine inverters in the field. Up to (4) PICS units can combine up to (15) 275kW inverters for a 4.2MVA power block. Since the PVI-CENTRAL-250-US is a 250kW inverter, more than 15 units would be required to reach 4.2MVA.

      "question": "Can Southern States' quick break arcing horns, used to interrupt line charging current on high voltage switches, be integrated as an accessory within an EPEC Solutions UL 891 certified SWBD operating at 480VAC, and if so, what considerations regarding interrupt ratings would need to be addressed?",
      "question_type": "multi_hop",
      "ground_truth": "Southern States' quick break arcing horns are designed for high voltage switches, as described in Bulletin 1400-A, while the EPEC Solutions SWBD operates at 480VAC or 600VAC according to the flyer. Integrating a high-voltage accessory within a low-voltage SWBD would not be a standard application and would likely require significant engineering modifications and careful consideration of interrupt ratings (100kAIC @ 480VAC and 65kAIC @ 600VAC for the SWBD) to ensure safe and effective operation.",
      "rag_answer": "Based on the provided documents, I cannot definitively answer whether Southern States' quick break arcing horns can be integrated as an accessory within an EPEC Solutions UL 891 certified SWBD operating at 480VAC.\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Voltage Mismatch:** Southern States' quick break arcing horns are designed for *high voltage* switches (Document 1 & 2). Document 2 mentions they are used through 161kV. EPEC Solutions' SWBD operates at 480VAC or 600VAC (Document 5), which is low voltage.\n*   **SWBD Function:** The EPEC Solutions SWBD is a low-voltage switchboard (Document 5), and arcing horns are typically used on disconnect switches to interrupt magnetizing and line charging currents (Document 1 & 2). These are different applications.\n*   **Interrupt Ratings:** Document 5 specifies interrupt ratings for the EPEC SWBD at 100kAIC @ 480VAC and 65kAIC @ 600VAC. If the arcing horns *could* be integrated (which is unlikely given the voltage difference), the resulting assembly would need to maintain or exceed these interrupt ratings to remain UL 891 compliant. However, since the arcing horns are not designed for this type of equipment, it is unlikely they would be compatible.\n\nIn summary, the voltage and application differences make direct integration unlikely.\n",
