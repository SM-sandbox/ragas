      "ground_truth": "Based on the BDM-2000-T datasheet, the recommended maximum PV power is 750W x 4, totaling 3000W. While the BDM-2000-T datasheet doesn't directly address panel upgrades, the NEP BDM-550 & BDM-650 whitepaper indicates that 100A service panels often require upgrades due to limited capacity and the 120% rule for solar back-feed. The BDM-550 and BDM-650 microinverters are designed to avoid panel upgrades by optimizing AC output current to stay within the 120% back-feed rule for 100A panels and allowing more units per circuit.",

It correctly identifies the need for upstream disconnection from both DC and AC sides, emphasizing the use of distribution line switches (which it correctly links to the main switchboard/MCCBs in the question) rather than inverter switches. While the Ground Truth primarily points to the manual as the source of the procedure and mentions another document for configuration details, the RAG answer goes further by *providing* the actual procedure, which is more directly responsive to the question 'What is the recommended procedure?'. It also successfully connects the general procedure to the specific power block context. The answer is highly faithful to the retrieved context and is presented with excellent clarity. It is slightly less complete than the GT in that it doesn't explicitly name the '800VAC Balance of System Equipment document', but it does address the configuration aspect."

      "ground_truth": "The maximum allowable solar back-feed for a 1000A panel is 1200A (120% of 1000A). The plant will need to upgrade the electrical service if they add 30A of backfeed to an existing 1000A panel because they will exceed the maximum allowable solar back-feed of 1200A. The NEP microinverters may be a viable solution to avoid upgrading the service panel if the back-feed can be optimized to stay within the 120% rule.",
      "rag_answer": "According to the NEC guidelines mentioned in the context, which state that for a 100A panel, 20A is the allowable back-feed (implying 20% of the panel rating), the maximum allowable solar back-feed current for a 1000A electrical service panel would be 200A (20% of 1000A).\n\nHowever, the NEP BDM-550 and BDM-650 microinverters would not be a viable solution for a manufacturing plant with a 480VAC electrical service panel. The context specifies that these microinverters are designed for 1-phase 240 Vac or 3-phase 208 Vac nominal power grid voltages, not 480 Vac. Therefore, they are incompatible with the plant's existing electrical service, regardless of the back-feed current needed.",

EPEC Solutions' UL 891 certified SWBDs, however, are low voltage (LV) switchboards designed for 480VAC (and up to 600VAC or 800VAC) [5, 7, 10]. These are fundamentally different voltage classes and product types.\n*   **Accessory Type:** The quick break arcing horns are described as accessories for high voltage group operated switches [1, 3]. The accessories mentioned in the context for low voltage circuit breakers (which are components of SWBDs) are internal items like auxiliary switches, alarm switches, shunt trips, and undervoltage releases [9]. There is no information suggesting that high voltage arcing horns are compatible or intended for use as accessories within a low voltage switchboard.\n\nSince the integration of these components is not supported by the context due to the fundamental differences in their design and intended application, considerations regarding interrupt ratings for such a combined system are not addressed in the provided information.

      "ground_truth": "The question requires knowing the 4000A, 1500VDC Recombiner Cabinet is for solar + storage (Document 1), and then identifying compatible PVI-CENTRAL inverter models based on country of sale (US or CAN) from Document 2. The question also implies the user needs to consult the inverter's user manual (Document 2) for installation and maintenance details, but the specific details are not contained in the document snippet.",

The recombiner, however, is rated for 1500VDC [2, 12]. This voltage mismatch means that no PVI-CENTRAL series inverter models are compatible with the specified recombiner.\n\nSince no models are compatible with this configuration, there are no specific installation and maintenance implications outlined in the inverter's user manual that would apply to such a setup.",

It directly addresses both parts of the question: compatibility and installation/maintenance implications. The explanation for incompatibility is clearly stated and directly supported by the retrieved context. The handling of the installation/maintenance part is also correct, as no specific details would apply to an incompatible setup, aligning with the ground truth's statement that such details are not in the snippet."

The CPS 125kW manual does not explicitly state a typical voltage range but specifies it is a grid-tied PV inverter which implies it is designed to handle the DC voltage output of solar panels, and the 60V would be a possible upper limit for the microinverter's DC voltage when considering its compatibility.",
