The Northwest\u2019s highest solar potential is east of\nthe Cascades. But even west of the Cascades, the Oregon\u2019s Willamette Valley receives\nas much solar energy annually as the U.S. average \u2013 as much over the course of the year\nas southern France and more than Germany, the current leader in solar electric\ninstallations. Under cloudy conditions, it is true that photovoltaics produce only 5 to 30\npercent of their maximum output. However, because solar photovoltaics become less\nefficient when hot, our cooler climate and our long summer days help make up for the\ncloudy days. Evaluating a Building Site \u2013 While the Pacific Northwest may have good to excellent\nsolar potential, not every building site will be suitable for a solar installation. The first\nstep in the design of a photovoltaic system is determining if the site you are considering\nhas good solar potential. Some questions you should ask are:\n\u2022 Is the installation site free from shading by nearby trees, buildings or other\nobstructions? \u2022 Can the PV system be oriented for good performance? \u2022 Does the roof or property have enough area to accommodate the solar array? \u2022 If the array will be roof-mounted, what kind of roof is it and what is its condition? Mounting Location \u2013 Solar modules are usually mounted on roofs. If roof area is not\navailable, PV modules can be pole-mounted, ground-mounted, wall-mounted or installed\nas part of a shade structure (refer to the section \u201cSystem Components/Array Mounting\nRacks\u201d below). Shading \u2013 Photovoltaic arrays are adversely affected by shading. A well-designed PV\nsystem needs clear and unobstructed access to the sun\u2019s rays from about 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.,\nthroughout the year. Even small shadows, such as the shadow of a single branch of a\nleafless tree can significantly reduce the power output of a solar module.1 Shading from\nthe building itself \u2013 due to vents, attic fans, skylights, gables or overhangs \u2013 must also be\navoided. Keep in mind that an area may be unshaded during one part of the day, but\nshaded at another part of the day. Also, a site that is unshaded in the summer may be\nshaded in the winter due to longer winter shadows.2\nOrientation \u2013 In northern latitudes, by conventional wisdom PV modules are ideally\noriented towards true south.3 But the tilt or orientation of a roof does not need to be\n1 This is because when manufacturers assemble solar modules from cells, they wire groups of cells in series\nwith each other. Shading one cell will essentially turn off all the cells in its group. 2 Shading can be evaluated using tools such as the \u201cSolar Path Finder\u201d (www.solarpathfinder.com). 3 Deviations between magnetic and true south, referred to as magnetic declination, vary by location."}

Roofs that face east or west may also be acceptable. As\nan example, a due west facing rooftop solar PV system, tilted at 20 degrees in Salem,\nOregon, will produce about 88 percent as much power as one pointing true south at the\nsame location. Flat roofs work well because the PV modules can be mounted on frames\nand tilted up toward true south. Optimum orientation can be influenced by typical local weather patterns. For example,\nwestern Washington and Oregon frequently have a marine layer of fog that burns off by\nlate morning and so have better solar resource after noon than before noon. Thus, west of\nthe Cascades, the maximum power is generated with a southwest orientation. Tilt \u2013 Generally the optimum tilt of a PV array in the Pacific Northwest equals the\ngeographic latitude minus about 15 degrees to achieve yearly maximum output of power. An increased tilt favors power output in the winter and a decreased tilt favors output in\nthe summer. In western Washington and Oregon, with their cloudier winters, the\noptimum angle is less than the optimum east of the Cascades. Nevertheless, it is recommended that modules be installed at the same pitch as a sloping\nroof, whatever that slope is, primarily for aesthetic reasons, but also because the tilt is\nvery forgiving. In Salem, Oregon, for example, tilts from 20 degrees to 45 degrees will\nresult in approximately the same power production over the course of the year. This is\nbecause tilts that are less than the latitude of the site increase summer production when\nthe solar resource is most available here, but reduce winter production when it tends to be\ncloudy anyway. Required Area \u2013 Residential and small commercial systems require as little as 50 square\nfeet for a small system up to as much as 1,000 square feet. As a general rule for the\nPacific Northwest, every 1,000 watts of PV modules requires 100 square feet of collector\narea for modules using crystalline silicon (currently the most common PV cell type). Each 1,000 watts of PV modules can generate about 1,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year\nin locations west of the Cascades and about 1,250 kWh per year east of the Cascades. When using less efficient modules, such as amorphous silicon or other thin-film types,\nthe area will need to be approximately doubled. If your location limits the physical size\nof your system, you may want to install a system that uses more-efficient PV modules. Keep in mind that access space around the modules can add up to 20 percent to the\nrequired area. Roof Types \u2013 For roof-mounted systems, typically composition shingles are easiest to\nwork with and slate and tile roofs are the most difficult. Nevertheless, it is possible to\ninstall PV modules on all roof types."}

These systems generate the same quality of alternating current\n(AC) electricity as is provided by your utility. The energy generated by a grid-connected\nsystem is used first to power the AC electrical needs of the home or business. Any\nsurplus power that is generated is fed or \u201cpushed\u201d onto the electric utility\u2019s transmission\ngrid. Any of the building\u2019s power requirements that are not met by the PV system are\npowered by the transmission grid. In this way, the grid can be thought of as a virtual\nbattery bank for the building.\nCommon System Types \u2013 Most new PV systems being installed in the United States are\ngrid-connected residential systems without battery back-up. Many grid-connected AC\nsystems are also being installed in commercial or public facilities.\nThe grid-connected systems we will be examining here are of two types, although others\nexist. These are:\n\u2022 Grid-connected AC system with no battery or generator back-up.\n\u2022 Grid-connected AC system with battery back-up.\nExample configurations of systems with and without batteries are shown in Figures 1 and\n2. Note there are common variations on the configurations shown, although the essential\nfunctions and general arrangement will be similar.4\nIs a Battery Bank Really Needed? \u2013 The simplest, most reliable, and least expensive\nconfiguration does not have battery back-up. Without batteries, a grid-connected PV\nsystem will shut down when a utility power outage occurs. Battery back-up maintains\npower to some or all of the electric equipment, such as lighting, refrigeration, or fans,\neven when a utility power outage occurs. A grid-connected system may also have\ngenerator back-up if the facility cannot tolerate power outages.\n4 As an example of a variation on the configuration shown in Figure 1, the inverter has been shown in an\ninterior location, while very often it is installed outside. If located outside, there may not be a need for a\nseparate Array Disconnect and Inverter DC Disconnect, as a single DC Disconnect can serve both\nfunctions. In Figure 2, system meter functions are often included in charge controllers and so a separate\nSystem Meter may not be required."}

Strings of modules are\nconnected in parallel to form an array.\nModule Types \u2013 Rigid flat framed modules are currently most common and most of these\nare composed of silicon. Silicon cells have atomic structures that are single-crystalline\n(a.k.a. mono-crystalline), poly-crystalline (a.k.a. multi-crystalline) or amorphous (a.k.a.\nthin film silicon). Other cell materials used in solar modules are cadmium telluride\n(CdTe, commonly pronounced \u201cCadTel\u201d) and copper indium diselenide (CIS). Some\nmodules are manufactured using combinations of these materials. An example is a thin\nfilm of amorphous silicon deposited onto a substrate of single-crystalline silicon."}

Building Integrated Photovoltaic Products \u2013 PV technology has been integrated into\nroofing tiles, flexible roofing shingles, roofing membranes, adhesive laminates for metal\nstanding-seam roofs, windows, and other building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV)\nproducts. BIPV modules are generally more expensive than rigid flat modules, but are\nanticipated to eventually reduce overall costs of a PV system because of their dual\npurpose. For more information on BIPV products, refer to the National Institute of\nBuilding Sciences\u2019 Whole Building Design Guide: Building Integrated Photovoltaics at\nRated Power \u2013 Grid-connected residential PV systems use modules with rated power\noutput ranging from 100-300 watts. Modules as small as 10 watts are used for other\napplications. Rated power is the maximum power the panel can produce with 1,000 watts\nof sunlight per square meter at a module temperature of 25oC or 77oF in still air. Actual\nconditions will rarely match rated conditions and so actual power output will almost\nalways be less. PV System Voltage \u2013 Modern systems without batteries are typically wired to provide\nfrom 235V to 600V. In battery-based systems, the trend is also toward use of higher\narray voltages, although many charge controllers still require lower voltages of 12V, 24V\nor 48V to match the voltage of the battery string. Using Manufacturer\u2019s Product Information to Compare Modules \u2013 Since module costs\nand efficiencies continue to change as technology and manufacturing methods improve, it\nis difficult to provide general recommendations that will be true into the future regarding,\nfor example, which type of module is cheapest or the best overall choice. It is best to\nmake comparisons based on current information provided by manufacturers, combined\nwith the specific requirements of your application. Two figures that are useful in comparing modules are the modules\u2019 price per watt and the\nrated power output per area (or efficiency). When looking through a manufacturer\u2019s\ncatalog of solar modules, you will often find the rated power, the overall dimensions of\nthe module, and its price. Find the cost per watt by dividing the module\u2019s price by its\nrated output in watts. Find the watts per area, by dividing its rated output by its area. Module Cost per Watt \u2013 As a general rule, thin film modules have lower costs than\ncrystalline silicon modules for modules of similar powers. For updates on module prices\nrefer to the Solarbuzz website at http://www.solarbuzz.com/ModulePrices.htm. Module Efficiency (Watts per Area) \u2013 Modules with higher efficiency will have a higher\nratio of watts to area. The higher the efficiency, the smaller the area (i.e."}

Amorphous Silicon in Cloudy Climates \u2013 Of importance to the Pacific Northwest,\namorphous silicon modules have higher efficiency than crystalline silicon under overcast\nconditions. In cloudy weather, all types of amorphous silicon modules tend to perform\nbetter than crystalline silicon, with multi-junction (i.e. double- and triple-junction)\namorphous silicon modules performing as much as 15 percent better. In Britain, which\nhas a similar climate to ours, multi-junction amorphous silicon modules have been shown\nto produce more power over the course of the year than crystalline silicon modules. Note that because the power ratings of modules are determined under high light, their\nrated efficiency (or rated watts per area), will not reflect performance in overcast\nweather. Poly-crystalline or Single-crystalline Silicon? \u2013 The power output of single-crystalline\nand poly-crystalline modules of the same area is quite similar.5 Both types of crystalline\nsilicon are very durable and have stable power output over time. Therefore, do not be too\nconcerned about the distinction between single-crystalline and poly-crystalline silicon in\nselecting a module. On the other hand, higher module efficiencies can be achieved by some combination\nproducts that have recently appeared on the market, such as amorphous silicon deposited\non a single-crystalline substrate. These high efficiency modules may be a good choice\nparticularly if the area available for the installation is limited. Silicon Modules versus Other Module Types? \u2013 The power output of CdTe modules has\nbeen less stable than silicon modules,6 although improvements are being made. For the\ntime being, as for modules of any type, check manufacturer\u2019s warranties. A warranty\nguaranteeing high power output over 20 to 25 years is an indication of the longevity of\nthe cell material. Warranty \u2013 It is important to verify warranty periods of all components of the system,\nincluding solar modules. Most modules are very durable, long lasting and can withstand\n5 Either single-crystalline or poly-crystalline modules may have a higher output for the same size module,\ndepending on how the manufacturer lays out the cells. Single-crystalline silicon cells have a higher\nefficiency (i.e. higher power output for a given cell area) compared to poly-crystalline. But this refers to\nthe efficiency of the material not the module, and does not account for lost area due to the spaces between\ncells. Single-crystalline cells can be more difficult to lay out compactly on a module because it is most\ntypically manufactured in circular sections. So while the poly-crystalline material itself is less efficient, it\noften is more compactly laid out on a module."}

Reflecting this longevity,\nmost silicon modules carry 20- or 25-year manufacturer warranties. Array Mounting Racks\nArrays are most commonly mounted on roofs or on steel poles set in concrete. In certain\napplications, they may be mounted at ground level or on building walls. Solar modules\ncan also be mounted to serve as part or all of a shade structure such as a patio cover. On\nroof-mounted systems, the PV array is typically mounted on fixed racks, parallel to the\nroof for aesthetic reasons and stood off several inches above the roof surface to allow\nairflow that will keep them as cool as practical. Adjustability \u2013 The tilt of sloped rooftop arrays is usually not changed, since this is\ninconvenient in many cases and sometimes dangerous. However, many mounting racks\nare adjustable, allowing resetting of the angle of the PV modules seasonally. Tracking \u2013 Pole-mounted PV arrays can incorporate tracking devices that allow the array\nto automatically follow the sun. Tracked PV arrays can increase the system\u2019s daily\nenergy output by 25 percent to 40 percent. Despite the increased power output, tracking\nsystems usually are not justified by the increased cost and complexity of the system. General Installation Notes \u2013 Proper roof mounting can be labor intensive, depending\nlargely on the type of roof and how the mounting brackets are installed and sealed. It is\nbest to follow the recommendations of the roofing contractor, racking system suppliers\nand module manufacturers. Module manufacturers will provide details of support\nrequirements for their modules. A good racking supplier will provide code-compliant\nengineering specifications with their product. As a general rule for bidding purposes,\nhowever, it is typical to have one support bracket for every 100 watts of PV modules. Particular attention must be given to securing the array directly to the structural members\nof the roof and to weather sealing of roof penetrations. All details regarding attaching the\nmounting brackets to the roof and sealing around them are best approved and carried out\nby the roofing contractor so that the roof warranty will not be voided. Asphalt Composition Roofs \u2013 For asphalt composition roofs, all mounts need to be\nsecured to the roof with stainless steel lag bolts, bolted into the rafters. Mount types\ninclude support posts and L-brackets. Support posts are preferred because they are\ndesigned to give a good seal on boots. Support posts are best mounted after the roof\ndecking is applied and before the roof material is installed. Support posts and roof jacks\nmay be installed by either the roofing contractor or the crew in charge of laying out the\narray mounting system. The roofing contractor then flashes around the posts as they\ninstall the roof. It is very common to install mounts after the roof is installed, drilling through the asphalt\ncomposition roofing to install the bolts."}

While this is much less labor intensive than when flashed, unless\nperformed by the roofing contractor, this method may void the warranty on the roof.\nMetal Roofs \u2013 There are several types of standing seam metal roof products, including\nvertical seam, horizontal seam and delta seam products. Currently, special clamps,\nreferred to as S-5 clamps, are available to attach arrays without any penetrations to\nvertical and horizontal seam roofs and certain other standing seam roof profiles. These\nclamps make installation of the solar array a relatively easy matter compared to any other\nroof type. In contrast, clamps for delta seam metal roofs are not available. For these\nroofs, it is necessary to cut into the roofing, install boots around the mounting posts, and\nthen seal the penetration. This being undesirable and labor intensive, it is best to clearly\nspecify in advance a vertical or horizontal seam metal roof or other roof type compatible\nwith S-5 clamps.\nOther Roof Types \u2013 While it is possible to install a PV array on shake, tile and slate\nroofs, these roof types pose certain problems. Contact the racking system supplier for\ninformation on products and installation methods for these roof types. Work directly\nwith the roofing contractor before ordering the racking system. Also look for roof-\nintegrated modules that can be used with tile or slate roofs.\nRoof Vents and Fans \u2013 We suggest installing roof vents, plumbing vents, and fans on the\nnorth side of the roof to avoid interference with the solar array. This will also reduce the\npotential for inadvertent shading of the array.\nFor More Information \u2013 Refer to Energy Trust of Oregon array mounting requirements\nin their Solar Electric System Installation Requirements available at\nto Photovoltaic System Design and Installation\u201d (California Energy Commission 2001).\nGrounding Equipment\nGrounding equipment provides a well-defined, low-resistance path from your system to\nthe ground to protect your system from current surges from lightning strikes or\nequipment malfunctions. Grounding also stabilizes voltages and provides a common\nreference point. The grounding harness is usually located on the roof.\nCheck with the AHJ \u2013 Grounding can be a particularly problematic issue. Be sure to\ncheck with the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) \u2013 typically the building department\u2019s\nelectrical inspector \u2013 concerning local code requirements.\nEquipment Grounding \u2013 Equipment grounding provides protection from shock caused\nby a ground fault. A ground fault occurs when a current-carrying conductor comes into\ncontact with the frame or chassis of an appliance or electrical box. All system\ncomponents and any exposed metal, including equipment boxes, receptacles, appliance\nframes and PV mounting equipment, should be grounded."}

In a DC system, this means bonding the negative\nconductor to ground at one single point in the system. This must be accomplished inside\nthe inverter, not at the PV array.\nNEC 2005 and System Grounding \u2013 In 2005, the National Electrical Code (NEC) was\nmodified to remove the requirement for system grounding, although your local\njurisdiction may not have adopted this revision. The requirement for system grounding\nwas removed to permit transformerless utility-interactive inverters, which have higher\nefficiency. There are several additional NEC requirements intended to ensure that\nungrounded arrays are as safe as grounded arrays, although this is still a point of\ncontroversy. Refer to NEC 690 (2005) for details, and to the IAEI News article\n\u201cPhotovoltaic Power Systems and 2005 NEC\u201d by John Wiles at\nCombiner Box\nWires from individual PV modules or strings are run to the combiner box, typically\nlocated on the roof. These wires may be single conductor pigtails with connectors that\nare pre-wired onto the PV modules. The output of the combiner box is one larger two-\nwire conductor in conduit. A combiner box typically includes a safety fuse or breaker for\neach string and may include a surge protector.\nSurge Protection\nSurge protectors help to protect your system from power surges that may occur if the PV\nsystem or nearby power lines are struck by lightning. A power surge is an increase in\nvoltage significantly above the design voltage.\nMeters and Instrumentation\nEssentially two types of meters are used in PV systems:\n\u2022 Utility Kilowatt-hour Meter\n\u2022 System Meter\nUtility Kilowatt-Hour Meter \u2013 The utility kilowatt-hour meter measures energy delivered\nto or from the grid. On homes with solar electric systems, utilities typically install\nbidirectional meters with a digital display that keeps separate track of energy in both\ndirections. Some utilities will allow you to use a conventional meter that can spin in\nreverse. In this case, the utility meter spins forward when you are drawing electricity\nfrom the grid and backwards when your system is feeding or \u201cpushing\u201d electricity onto\nthe grid.\nSystem Meter \u2013 The system meter measures and displays system performance and status.\nMonitored points may include power production by modules, electricity used, and battery"}

There are essentially two types of grid-interactive inverters: those\ndesigned for use with batteries and those designed for a system without batteries.\nPower Quality \u2013 Inverters for grid-connected systems produce better than utility-quality\npower. For grid-connection, the inverter must have the words \u201cUtility-Interactive\u201d\nprinted directly on the listing label.\nVoltage Input \u2013 The inverter\u2019s DC voltage input window must match the nominal\nvoltage of the solar array, usually 235V to 600V for systems without batteries and 12, 24\nor 48 volts for battery-based systems.\nAC Power Output \u2013 Grid-connected systems are sized according to the power output of\nthe PV array, rather than the load requirements of the building. This is because any\npower requirements above what a grid-connected PV system can provide is automatically\ndrawn from the grid."}

When starting, a motor may draw as much as seven\ntimes its rated wattage. For grid-connected systems, this start-up surge is automatically\ndrawn from the grid.\nFrequency and Voltage Regulation \u2013 Better quality inverters will produce near constant\noutput voltage and frequency.\nEfficiency \u2013 Modern inverters commonly used in residential and small commercial\nsystems have peak efficiencies of 92 percent to 94 percent, as rated by their\nmanufacturers. Actual field conditions usually result in overall efficiencies of about 88\npercent to 92 percent. Inverters for battery-based systems have slightly lower\nefficiencies.\nIntegral Safety Disconnects \u2013 The AC disconnect in most inverter models may not meet\nrequirements of the electric utility (see section \u201cDisconnects\u201d). Therefore, a separate\nexterior AC disconnect may be required even if one is included in the inverter. All\ninverters that are UL listed for grid-connection include both DC disconnects (PV input)\nand AC disconnects (inverter output). In better inverters, the inverter section can be\nremoved separately from the DC and AC disconnects, facilitating repair.\nMaximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) \u2013 Modern non-battery based inverters include\nmaximum power point tracking. MPPT automatically adjusts system voltage such that\nthe PV array operates at its maximum power point. For battery-based systems, this\nfeature has recently been incorporated into better charge controllers.\nInverter-Chargers \u2013 For battery-based systems, inverters are available with a factory-\nintegrated charge controller, referred to as inverter-chargers. Be sure to select an\ninverter-charger that is rated for grid-connection, however. In the event of a grid power\noutage, use of an inverter-charger that is not set up for grid-connection would result in\novercharging and damaging the batteries, known as \u201ccooking the batteries.\u201d\nAutomatic Load Shedding \u2013 For battery-based systems, the inverter can automatically\nshed any unnecessary loads in the event of a utility power outage. Solar loads, i.e. the\nloads that will be kept powered up during the outage, are connected to a separate\nelectrical sub-panel. A battery-based system must be designed to power these critical\nloads.\nWarranty \u2013 Inverters typically carry warranties of 5 years, although the industry is\nmoving toward a 10-year warranty. The transformer and solid state components of an\ninverter are both susceptible to overheating and damage from power spikes, reducing its\nlife. Transformerless inverters, long available in Europe, are beginning to move into the\nU.S. market.\nTo Consider When Researching Inverters \u2013 Many references on sizing and selecting\ninverters have been developed for off-grid systems, but may not clearly state that they are"}

Sizing and selecting grid-connected inverters entails\ndifferent considerations and is easier, since the system does not have to provide 100\npercent of the energy requirements. In particular, peak energy demand and surge\ncapacity do not need to be considered for grid-connected systems.\nDisconnects\nAutomatic and manual safety disconnects protect the wiring and components from power\nsurges and other equipment malfunctions. They also ensure the system can be safely shut\ndown and system components can be removed for maintenance and repair. For grid-\nconnected systems, safety disconnects ensure that the generating equipment is isolated\nfrom the grid, which is important for the safety of utility personnel. In general, a\ndisconnect is needed for each source of power or energy storage device in the system.\nFor each of the functions listed below, it is not always necessary to provide a separate\ndisconnect. For example, if an inverter is located outdoors, a single DC disconnect can\nserve the function of both the array DC disconnect and the inverter DC disconnect.\nBefore omitting a separate disconnect, however, consider if this will ever result in an\nunsafe condition when performing maintenance on any component. Also consider the\nconvenience of the disconnect\u2019s location. An inconveniently located disconnect may lead\nto the tendency to leave the power on during maintenance, resulting in a safety hazard.\nArray DC Disconnect \u2013 The array DC disconnect, also called the PV disconnect, is used\nto safely interrupt the flow of electricity from the PV array for maintenance or\ntroubleshooting. The array DC disconnect may also have integrated circuit breakers or\nfuses to protect against power surges.\nInverter DC Disconnect \u2013 Along with the inverter AC disconnect, the inverter DC\ndisconnect is used to safely disconnect the inverter from the rest of the system. In many\ncases, the inverter DC disconnect will also serve as the array DC disconnect.\nInverter AC Disconnect \u2013 The inverter AC disconnect disconnects the PV system from\nboth the building\u2019s electrical wiring and the grid. Frequently, the AC disconnect is\ninstalled inside the building\u2019s main electrical panel. However, if the inverter is not\nlocated near the electrical panel, an additional AC disconnect should be installed near the\ninverter.\nExterior AC Disconnect \u2013 Utilities commonly require an exterior AC disconnect that is\nlockable, has visible blades and is mounted next to the utility meter so that it is accessible\nto utility personnel. An AC disconnect located inside the electrical panel or integral to\nthe inverter would not satisfy these requirements. One alternative that is as acceptable to\nsome utilities as an accessible AC disconnect is the removal of the meter itself, but this is\nnot the norm. Prior to purchasing equipment, consult the electric utility to determine\ntheir requirements for interconnection."}

This energy storage comes at\na cost, however, since batteries reduce the efficiency and output of the PV system,\ntypically by about 10 percent for lead-acid batteries. Batteries also increase the\ncomplexity and cost of the system.\nTypes of batteries commonly used in PV systems are:\n\u2022 Lead-acid batteries\n- Flooded (a.k.a. Liquid vented)\n- Sealed (a.k.a. Valve-Regulated Lead Acid)\no Absorbent glass mat\no Gel cell\n\u2022 Alkaline batteries\n- Nickel-cadmium\n- Nickel-iron\nLead-Acid Batteries \u2013 Lead-acid batteries are most common in PV systems in general\nand sealed lead acid batteries are most commonly used in grid-connected systems.\nSealed batteries are spill-proof and do not require periodic maintenance. Flooded lead-\nacid batteries are usually the least expensive but require adding distilled water at least\nmonthly to replenish water lost during the normal charging process.\nThere are two types of sealed lead acid batteries: sealed absorbent glass mat (AGM) and\ngel cell. AGM lead-acid batteries have become the industry standard, as they are\nmaintenance free and particularly suited for grid-tied systems where batteries are\ntypically kept at a full state of charge. Gel-cell batteries, designed for freeze-resistance,\nare generally a poor choice because any overcharging will permanently damage the\nbattery.\nAlkaline Batteries \u2013 Because of their relatively high cost, alkaline batteries are only\nrecommended where extremely cold temperatures (-50oF or less) are anticipated or for\ncertain commercial or industrial applications requiring their advantages over lead-acid\nbatteries. These advantages include tolerance of freezing or high temperatures, low\nmaintenance requirements, and the ability to be fully discharged or over-charged without\nharm.\nSizing Battery Banks \u2013 For grid-connected systems, batteries are usually sized for\nrelatively short time periods with 8 hours being typical. Size may vary, however,\ndepending on the particular needs of a facility and the length of power outages expected.\nFor comparison, battery banks for off-grid systems are usually sized for one to three\ncloudy days."}

It is important that the voltage is high\nmpp\nenough relative to the voltage of a fully charged battery. For example, rated voltages\nbetween 16.5V and 17.5V are typical for a 12V system using liquid lead-acid batteries.\nHigher voltages may be required for long wiring distances between the modules and the\ncharge controller and battery bank.\nCharge Controller\nA charge controller, sometimes referred to as a photovoltaic controller or battery\ncharger, is only necessary in systems with battery back-up.

In addition, charge\ncontrollers prevent charge from draining back to solar modules at night. Some modern\ncharge controllers incorporate maximum power point tracking, which optimizes the PV\narray\u2019s output, increasing the energy it produces.\nTypes of Charge Controllers \u2013 There are essentially two types of controllers: shunt and\nseries. A shunt controller bypasses current around fully charged batteries and through a\npower transistor or resistance heater where excess power is converted into heat. Shunt\ncontrollers are simple and inexpensive, but are only designed for very small systems.\nSeries controllers stop the flow of current by opening the circuit between the battery and\nthe PV array. Series controllers may be single-stage or pulse type. Single-stage\ncontrollers are small and inexpensive and have a greater load-handling capacity than\nshunt-type controllers. Pulse controllers and a type of shunt controller referred to as a\nmulti-stage controller (e.g., three-stage controller) have routines that optimize battery\ncharging rates to extend battery life.\nMost charge controllers are now three-stage controllers.

We suggest an on-site\npreconstruction meeting with the electrician and the solar installer to discuss where one\njob ends and the other begins.\nConstructing a \u201cSolar Ready\u201d Building \u2013 Even if the PV system is not installed during\nconstruction of the building, the builder can install those runs of conduit that would be\ndifficult to do later as a retrofit, thus making the building \u201csolar ready.\u201d\nInvestigate the Vendor\u2019s History \u2013 It is important to investigate the track record of all\nvendors, including the warranties they offer on equipment. As one example, when\nAstroPower went bankrupt and was acquired by General Electric in 2004, the warranties\non previously manufactured AstroPower modules were not honored by General Electric.\n7 As mentioned before, install vents and fans on the north side of the roof to avoid interference with the\nsolar array."}

When there is a conflict between\nNEC 690 and any other article, NEC 690 takes precedence due to the unique nature of\nPV systems. Articles of the NEC applicable to PV systems are:\n\u2022 NEC 690 \u2013 Solar Photovoltaic Systems\n\u2022 NEC 230 \u2013 Disconnect Means\n\u2022 NEC 240 \u2013 Overcurrent Protection\n\u2022 NEC 250 \u2013 Grounding\n\u2022 NEC 300 to NEC 384 \u2013 Wiring Methods\nA good summary of NEC 690 (2002) is given in Photovoltaics: Design and Installation\nManual (Solar Energy International 2007) in the chapter titled \u201cSystem Wiring.\u201d NEC\n690 includes requirements on sizing, selecting and installation of wiring, conduit,\novercurrent protection, disconnects, and grounding. NEC 690 addresses many other\nissues as well, such as interconnection to the utility grid, equipment listing, and\ninspection.\nNote that a new edition of NEC 690 was released in 2005. For a summary, refer to the\narticle \u201cPhotovoltaic Power Systems and 2005 NEC\u201d (IAEI News, March/April 2005),\nwhich is available at both http://www.nmsu.edu/~tdi/pdf-resources/IAEI-3to4-05.pdf and\nSafety During the Installation\nRoof-mounted PV systems require that subcontractors, including electricians, work on\nthe roof. It is the builder\u2019s legal responsibility to ensure that the installer follows safe\npractices during the installation. Lack of proper safety equipment can result in significant\nfines to the builder. For details of safety requirements refer to the federal Occupational\nSafety and Health Administration\u2019s (OSHA) 2001 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter\n29 Part 1926, \u201cSafety and Health Regulations for Construction\u201d at www.osha.gov.\nA danger specific to PV systems is that solar modules generate DC electricity when\nexposed to light. As well, PV systems may have multiple electrical sources \u2013 modules,\nthe utility grid, and perhaps batteries. Manufacturers of modules and other electrical\ncomponents will provide safety precautions that should be carefully followed.\nIn addition to the electrical hazards, hefting modules onto a sloped roof poses a hazard.\nWhen installing modules on the roof, at least one safety eye must be installed for tying"}

Work is facilitated by installing two safety eyes and a line between them for\nattaching the lanyard, thus allowing the installer to move back and forth more freely.\nSpecial Considerations in Wiring PV Systems\nIn wiring solar PV systems, there are at least two concerns that an electrical contractor or\nelectrician may not have previous experience with. First, the system on the array side of\nthe inverter must be designed for DC power, which requires larger wire sizes than for AC\npower at the same voltage. Second, array wiring must be sized and selected to withstand\nelevated temperatures. The ampacity, which is the current-carrying ability of a wire,\nmust be adjusted to account for temperature conditions that occur in PV systems. Wiring\nsizing is detailed in NEC 690. Worksheets on wiring sizing are included in the\nPhotovoltaics: Design and Installation Manual (Solar Energy International 2007). Refer\nto the section \u201cFor More Information \u2013 References\u201d below for ordering information.\nExterior Wiring \u2013 For PV systems in general, wiring in exterior locations must be\nsuitable for the outdoor, wet environment; suitable for exposure to sunlight; and able to\noperate in temperatures in the range of 65-80oC (149-176\u00b0 F). Wiring will be subjected\nto the highest temperatures in the junction boxes of solar modules; these conductors\nshould have insulation rated for 90oC (194\u00b0 F).\nModule Pigtails \u2013 In contrast to other NEC articles, NEC 690 allows exposed, single-\nconductor cables for interconnecting PV modules. This allows PV modules to be\nmanufactured with permanently attached pigtail conductors with multi-contact (MC)\nconnectors on the ends. Such module pigtails are becoming standard and significantly\nreduce the labor required for installing the array.\nRoofing Penetrations for Conduit \u2013 Particular attention should be paid to sealing around\nroof penetrations for conduit. As with sealing around the array mounting brackets, this is\nbest handled by the roofing contractor to ensure the roof warranty is not voided."}

To address this concern, many\ndistributors offer pre-engineered systems in which components are selected to work\ntogether as a unit. Pre-engineering may not guarantee a flawless system, but the concerns\nover product compatibility and specification of individual components will have been\naddressed up front.\nPV Modules and the Building Design \u2013 The builder or PV designer must also consider\nthe PV system and the building as a system. The PV array should be located considering\nthe aesthetics of the building. As well, the modules must be located so that building\nfeatures such as gables and overhangs do not shade the modules. This usually means\nlocating the array on the roof as close as possible to the ridge.\nThe builder should consider designing a south facing roof for the array for optimum\npower production. As noted previously, the orientation of the array is very forgiving,\nhowever, and the roof does not need to face directly south, if not possible given other\ndesign constraints.\nDesign Resources\nPrinted References \u2013 There are many good references and resources that provide in-\ndepth discussions of the technical aspects of system design. Two design references are:\n(cid:131) Photovoltaics: Design and Installation Manual, Solar Energy International (SEI),\n2007.\nThis manual has worksheets, guidelines and considerations for sizing and wiring\nsolar arrays, battery systems, inverters, and other system components.

Larger systems, of course, cost more in absolute terms than\nsmaller systems, but the cost per installed watt is somewhat less. Incentive programs can\nsubstantially reduce installed costs. For more information on incentives, visit the DSIRE\ndatabase at www.dsireusa.org. In Oregon, visit the Energy Trust of Oregon website at\nComponent Costs \u2013 Solar modules are the most expensive component of the system.\nInformation on typical system component prices can be found on the website of\nSolarbuzz at http://www.solarbuzz.com/Moduleprices.htm. In 2009, the cost of modules\nin the United States typically ranges from $4 to $6 per watt. In a system without\nbatteries, inverters are the second most costly component. In 2009, inverters cost on\naverage less than $1 per watt. Batteries increase the complexity of the system and thus\nimpact both material and labor costs. In 2009, batteries cost on average $2 per watt-hour.\nCost Tradeoffs \u2013 Consider cost tradeoffs when planning a PV system. For example,\nwhile less efficient modules may have a lower cost per installed watt than modules with\nhigher efficiency, they also will take up more space and require a larger racking system.\nMounting costs will be considerably greater and should be considered against the cost\nsavings of the modules.\nLabor Costs \u2013 The labor required to install a PV system varies depending on building\nlayouts and roofing types. An experienced crew can install a 2 kW non-battery PV\nsystem in two- to four-person days. Systems with large solar arrays require relatively\nless effort per watt of power than smaller systems. If batteries are included in the PV\nsystem, both material and installation costs will be greater. Batteries can add 50 percent\nto 100 percent to the time required for the installation."}
