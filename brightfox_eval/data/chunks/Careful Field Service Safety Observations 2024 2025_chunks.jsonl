During a morning vehicle inspection, I found one of the truck\u2019s rear brake lights was\nout. This could have led to unsafe driving conditions, especially during long highway\nruns. The issue was reported and corrected before departure.\n2. While moving through a substation yard, I spotted a partially buried cable protruding\nabove ground. It created a trip hazard near the walkway. I flagged it with caution\ntape and reported it to site operations.\n3. A coworker attempted to lift a junction box without assistance. The weight exceeded\nsafe manual lifting limits. I stopped work and reminded the team to use a two-\nperson lift or mechanical aid.\n4. During PPE checks, a technician had a cracked face shield. This would not have\nprovided proper arc-flash protection during switching. The shield was replaced\nbefore work started.\n5. While driving to site, I observed a tech on our crew using their phone to check\ndirections. This presented a distracted driving hazard. I reminded them to use\nhands-free navigation before continuing.\n6. At a wind site, I found the turbine tower ladder fall-arrest system had a frayed\nsection of cable. I locked out the climb and called in maintenance. No climbing was\nperformed until it was corrected.\n7. While reviewing site access, a truck entered the access road too quickly, kicking up\ndust and reducing visibility. I reminded the driver about speed control and safe\napproach on unpaved roads.\n8. At the battery storage yard, a cooling fan cover was missing on one container unit.\nThis exposed sharp edges and moving parts. Work was stopped until the area was\nmade safe.\n9. A spilled cup of coffee in the control trailer created a slip hazard near the entrance. I\ncleaned the area and placed a sign until dry. Such small hazards can lead to injuries\nif not addressed."}

While conducting a lockout/tagout, I noticed the tag did not include the technician\u2019s\nfull name and date. Incomplete information could cause confusion during shift\nhandover. The tag was corrected immediately.\n11. On the way to a solar site, our truck\u2019s low tire pressure indicator came on. We pulled\nover and confirmed one tire was at 50% pressure. It was unsafe to continue until the\ntire was repaired.\n12. While walking a PV array row, I tripped slightly over a grounding cable that was not\nsecured tightly. This could easily cause a fall. I reported it and placed a cone until\nrepair.\n13. During inverter troubleshooting, a technician reached into the cabinet without\nvoltage testing the bus first. I stopped them and reminded them of the test-before-\ntouch rule. Work resumed safely afterward.\n14. At the EV charging site, I saw an extension cord being used across a walkway. It\nposed a trip hazard for pedestrians. I re-routed the cord overhead with a hook.\n15. While performing a harness check, I noticed one lanyard hook was cracked. Using\nthis could have resulted in fall arrest failure. The equipment was tagged out and\nreplaced.\n16. Driving through a rural access road, I saw deer crossing ahead. Quick braking\nprevented a collision, but it reinforced the need to watch wildlife in these areas. The\ncrew was reminded at tailboard.\n17. At a BESS container, a technician attempted to bypass a panel interlock. I stopped\nthe work and reinforced that interlocks must never be bypassed. The supervisor was\ninformed.\n18. While unloading tools from the truck bed, one of the ratchet straps failed. Tools\nnearly fell onto the ground and could have struck feet. Straps were replaced with\nnew ones.\n19. At the substation, I found a missing ground clamp on a portable grounding set. This\ncould compromise electrical safety. The set was removed from service immediately.\n20. A colleague reported dizziness after climbing a turbine tower. We stopped work and\nescorted them down carefully. Hydration and rest were provided before returning to\nwork.\n21. While reviewing a fire extinguisher at site, I found the gauge was in the red zone. This\nunit would not have functioned in an emergency. The extinguisher was replaced."}

While walking across the solar field, uneven ground caused a near ankle twist. I\nmarked the depression and reported it to site management for grading.\n23. In the control trailer, an overloaded power strip was being used for multiple\nchargers. This created a fire hazard. I redistributed loads and unplugged\nnonessential devices.\n24. During a storm, a technician attempted to continue working outdoors near the array.\nLightning was approaching. I stopped all work until conditions were safe.\n25. While inspecting safety glasses, I found one pair without side shields. These would\nnot protect adequately during grinding work. Correct PPE was issued before the\ntask.\n26. At a wind farm parking area, I noticed a truck parked blocking the fire lane. This\ncould impede emergency access. The vehicle was moved immediately.\n27. A site worker was carrying two heavy toolboxes without gloves. One slipped and\nnearly pinched their hand. Gloves and a two-person carry were required moving\nforward.\n28. While testing a disconnect switch, the handle was stiff and did not fully engage. This\ncould leave equipment partially energized. I tagged it and reported it for\nmaintenance.\n29. A vehicle inspection revealed windshield wipers that were worn out. Rain was\nforecast that afternoon, making this unsafe. Wipers were replaced before driving.\n30. During trench work for conduit, a worker stepped too close to the edge of the\nexcavation without shoring. I stopped them and reminded about cave-in risk.\nBarricades were added.\n31. At the solar array, a panel junction box was open with exposed wiring. I stopped\nwork in the row and reported it for immediate repair. Area was taped off.\n32. While transporting a ladder, a technician carried it horizontally without a spotter. It\nnearly struck another worker passing by. I corrected the method and provided a\nspotter.\n33.

A truck parked on uneven ground rolled slightly because wheel chocks were not\nplaced. The movement was caught in time. Wheel chocks are now mandated during\nall stops on slope.\n35. While using a grinder, a worker did not secure their sleeves. The fabric nearly caught\nin the tool. I stopped the work and reminded about tight-fitting clothing.\n36. At a charging site, I saw a chemical spill from a leaking battery pack. I stopped the\njob and called HAZMAT for proper cleanup. No one was injured.\n37. A technician was about to enter a confined space container without a gas test. I\nintervened and ensured proper testing was performed first. The area was safe after\nclearance.\n38. During pre-drive, I found the truck\u2019s rearview mirror loose. This could have led to\npoor visibility. The issue was fixed before heading out.\n39. While climbing stairs to the substation control house, I noticed ice accumulation. It\ncreated a slip hazard. I applied ice melt and posted caution signage.\n40. A coworker removed gloves to handle energized testing probes. I immediately\nstopped them and reminded about electrical PPE requirements. Correct gloves\nwere worn thereafter.\n41. While checking grounding mats, I noticed corrosion around one bond point. This\ncould compromise protection. The mat was replaced before continuing work.\n42. During a site walk, I found debris and packaging left in the walkway. It created a trip\nhazard. I cleaned the area and reminded the crew to keep clear paths.\n43. At the inverter skid, a cooling fan blade guard was missing. This posed a risk of\ncontact with rotating equipment. The unit was tagged until fixed.\n44. While fueling the truck, a technician left the nozzle unattended. This is unsafe and\ncould result in a spill. I reminded them to remain at the pump.\n45. On a long drive between sites, a crew member began showing signs of fatigue. We\npulled over and switched drivers. Breaks were reinforced for long-distance travel.\n46. A site visitor attempted to enter without PPE. I stopped them and issued a hard hat,\nsafety glasses, and vest. Orientation was provided before allowing entry.\n47.

At a turbine pad, hydraulic oil was found leaking from a tool. I stopped use and\nreported it to prevent slip hazards and environmental contamination.\n49. While conducting an overhead lift, a rigger signaled without eye contact to the\noperator. This created confusion and nearly caused a dropped load. We reinforced\nclear communication protocols.\n50. While inspecting the ladder rack in the inverter station, I noticed the ladder feet\nwere not fully stable on the gravel surface. I secured the base with rubber mats\nbefore use. A potential fall hazard was avoided.\n51. While walking near a BESS container, I found a set of unsecured gas cylinders\nstanding upright without chains. These could easily tip and cause serious injury. I\nsecured them and notified the site lead.\n52. During a pre-job briefing, one technician admitted to not sleeping well after a long\ndrive. We decided to reassign tasks to avoid fatigue-related mistakes. Rest\nrequirements were reinforced for the team.\n53. At the solar site, I found a live ant mound directly in front of a combiner box. It could\ncause technicians to trip or be bitten while servicing. The area was treated before\nproceeding.\n54. A worker was using earbuds while driving the site truck. This limited awareness of\nsirens and alarms. The behavior was corrected immediately.\n55. While handling a torque wrench, a technician used the wrong setting and nearly\nover-tightened a bus connection. I intervened and reminded the crew about\nverifying torque values against the work order.\n56. At the base of a turbine, I noticed coolant fluid dripping from a hose connection. It\nwas creating a slick surface near the ladder entry. I placed absorbent pads and\nreported the leak.\n57. During a tool check, one worker\u2019s insulated screwdriver had a cracked handle. The\ndamage exposed conductive metal. The tool was removed from service.\n58. While approaching the yard, a semi-truck blocked the only emergency exit gate. I\ncontacted the driver and cleared the access immediately. This highlighted the\nimportance of keeping exits unobstructed.\n59. A team member almost stepped backward off a loading dock while giving hand\nsignals. I reminded everyone to stay situationally aware during rigging operations.\nGuard rails were also reinstalled."}
