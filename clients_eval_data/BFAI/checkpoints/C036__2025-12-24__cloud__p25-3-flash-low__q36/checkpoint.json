They feature RS485 ports (including 2+6pin and 8 pin connectors) and a selector switch (S201) for a 120\u03a9 termination resistor [1][7].\n*   **Siemens COM800/COM100 Breaker Data Servers:** These feature an Ethernet 10/100 Mbit/s interface and communicate via Ethernet (Modbus TCP) [2]. They also support optional expansion modules for PROFIBUS DP, PROFINET, or RS485 (Modbus RTU) [2].\n*   **Shark 100/100T Meters:** These provide two independent communication ports: Com 1 is an Optical IrDA Port (Modbus ASCII only), and Com 2 provides RS-485 communication supporting Modbus ASCII, Modbus RTU, and DNP 3.0 protocols [3][5][8].\n*   **PVI-6000-OUTD-US / Aurora Inverters:** These utilize an RS-485 serial interface for remote monitoring and include a USB port for access during installation [9]. They can also connect to an Aurora Easy-Control system for monitoring via the Internet, analogue modem, or GSM digital modem [9].\n*   **PVI-CENTRAL-XXX:** This device includes a Type B USB for PC connection, a connector for external (USER) RS485 communication, and a connector for internal RS485 communication [4].\n*   **EMB AcquiSuite A8810:** This device features a USB Port, RS485 TX/RX, and an Ethernet Port [6].",

Document [10] shows a three-pole circuit breaker with a 200 Amp rating [10].\n*   **Vacuum Fault Interrupters (VFI):** A Pad-Mounted VFI transformer uses a VFI breaker that provides over-current protection [11]. This breaker can initiate operation based on any one of the three phases, but performs a mechanical gang trip of all three phases to protect against single phasing [11].\n*   **Grounding and Overcurrent Protection:** Various excerpts from the National Electrical Code (2023 Edition) detail regulations for overcurrent protection [1] grounding and bonding [2][3][4][6] and motor circuits [5].\n*   **Electronic Metering:** The Shark 100/100T User Manual details configuration menus for current transformers (Ct), potential transformers (Pt), and connection settings (Cnct) [9] as well as reset (rSt) and configuration (CFG) options [8][12][13].\n\nBecause the specific term \"A32 Trip Units\" does not appear in the provided text or captions, the three protection configurations for that specific model cannot be identified from these documents.",
