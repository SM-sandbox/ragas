It utilizes a simple cam mechanism shielded from ice formation to ensure operation regardless of environmental conditions [5].\n*   **Installation:** It is designed for easy installation after the vertical operating pipe is in place, which facilitates later equipment upgrades [5].\n*   **Regulatory Requirements:** According to the National Electrical Code (NEC) 2023, mechanical interlocks must be provided in the housing to prevent the complete withdrawal of a circuit breaker from the housing when the stored energy mechanism is fully charged, unless a device is provided to block the closing function before withdrawal [3].\n*   **Other Applications:**\n    *   **NOARK A32 Series:** Uses a cable-connected mechanism to prevent two interlocked breakers from closing at the same time [1].\n    *   **Siemens:** Offers mechanical interlocks for various breaker types, including a sliding bar for 2 circuit breakers [7] and specific brackets for Type QP, BL, and BQ breakers [2].\n    *   **UL Standards:** Mechanical interlocks must have the necessary mechanical strength for reliable performance and must be mounted so that removing a door or barrier does not defeat the mechanism [6].",

It is noted for having low purchase and maintenance costs and being readily available [1].\n*   **Silicone liquid (or Silicone oil):** This fluid is ideal for transformer applications due to its heat stability, material compatibility, low flammability, and low toxicity [2]. It has a high fire point of 340\u00b0C (also listed as 330\u00b0C in property tables) and is UL Listed and factory mutual approved for both indoor and outdoor applications [2][1].\n*   **Envirotemp FR3 insulating oil (or FR3 fluid):** This is a natural ester, soybean oil-based dielectric fluid that is fully biodegradable and environmentally friendly [2][3]. It has a high flash point of 330\u00b0C (also listed as 343\u00b0C in property tables) and a fire point of 360\u00b0C [1].\n\nSources: [1][2][3]",
