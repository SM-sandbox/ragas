    "question": "An industrial facility requires a 480V, 3-phase circuit to be protected for a 100A continuous load, with an expected fault current of 65kA. This protection must utilize a Siemens 3VA TMTU circuit breaker. For the cabling, the facility specifies a 3-conductor Southwire Type TC-ER power cable that is a standard stock item, features a green insulated ground, and has a main conductor size of 1/0 AWG.\n1. Identify the complete Siemens 3VA circuit breaker part number for this application.\n2. What is the stock number and the size of the green insulated ground conductor for the specified Southwire cable?",
    "ground_truth": "1. Based on the Siemens 3VA Enclosed Circuit Breaker Quick Reference, for a 100A, 3P, 65KAIC @ 480V TMTU breaker, the complete part number is 3VA5110-6EC31-0AA0.\n2. According to the Southwire Type TC-ER Power Cable datasheet (Table 1), for a 1/0 AWG, 3-conductor cable with a green insulated ground (",

      "root_cause": "The RAG system successfully retrieved relevant documents (indicated by RECALL: True and MRR: 1.0) and the model faithfully used the information from these documents (faith=5). However, the final answer was incorrect (corr=1). This indicates that while the retrieved documents were relevant, they did not contain the complete, precise, or unambiguous information required to derive the exact Siemens part number and Southwire cable specifications based on all the specified parameters. The context provided to the LLM was insufficient for a fully correct answer, even though the LLM processed it faithfully.",
      "recommendation": "Enhance chunking strategies for technical documents and datasheets to ensure that all interdependent pieces of information (e.g., an entire row in a specification table, or a product description with all its associated parameters) are kept together within a single retrieved chunk. Implement more robust table and structured data extraction methods to accurately capture precise numerical and categorical specifications. Consider a multi-stage retrieval approach where initial relevant chunks trigger a more focused retrieval for specific details or cross-references within the same document."
